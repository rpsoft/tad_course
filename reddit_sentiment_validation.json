is my entry for the 2015 Blizzard Student Art Contest and its based off of Hearthstone! :D","1":"Cool stuff.\n\nOnly thing that stood out to me was the Saloon letters, and how they didn't cast shadow on the wooden planks behind them. It makes them look very floaty. If you just slap on some ambient occlusion on that area, it would look sweet.","2":"Kinda awesome. What did you do it in? ","3":"I used Maya, 3DCoat, Photoshop, and Unreal!","4":"Awesome job. ","5":"that's awesome! wp =)","6":"This is very cool.","7":"very cool :)","8":"Might just be me but the frog looks completely photoshopped in the first picture. Not sure if that's intended, as the rest of the pictures make it look like an actual 3d model.\n\nBesides that, very well done, I like it.","9":"I always see commercials where they advertise their food being homemade or made \"fresh\". Is that not false advertising?","10":"Homemade doesn't mean it was made at home. And fresh just means it's prepared when you order it, not premade and kept under heat lamps for hours. ","11":"Usually fast food commercials will say \"homemade recipes\", I'm not sure if they exactly refer to the food itself as \"homemade\" but the times they do I think they either refer to the food being cooked in that \"homemade recipe\" - like \"homemade chicken\" meaning \"chicken of that homemade recipe\" - or \"giving a homemade experience\". \n\n\"Homemade recipes\" is not considered false advertising as it only implies that the \"recipe\" is homemade - which really says nothing except having a nice ring to it. In effect I could cook something and call it a \"homemade recipe\" despite having no culinary experience.\n\n\nAs to \"fresh\": fresh is kinda arbitrary. They do restock their supplies every morning so they can argue that the items are \"fresh\". Now the stuff they give you might or might not have been processed by a factory a few days ago, but as far as they're concerned if the product's not fresh, that's the suppliers' faults and not their advertising being false - they did receive the ingredients \"freshly in the morning\".\n\nAs for \"freshly made\", the fries they give you were not a moment ago sitting in the oil. The patties they put in your burger were put on the pans as orders are filled (precooked but freshly seared).\n\nIt's all so morally grey that there's no way to claim that they're falsely advertising their product without some way to refute that claim, and even if you find proof, they can always claim to be the unaware and shove all the responsibility onto the suppliers.","12":"They're probably using \"homemade\" to reference where the recipe is from. They're saying, \"this is the same recipe that 'grandma' used to make her homemade biscuits 30 years ago.\" Darkchyylde already explained how they get away with saying \"fresh.\"","13":"I lost my mother in 2002 when I was 9. Every year since them, I have written a poem to her and sent it up in a balloon. Since it's mothers' day, I guess I'd like to ask you guys what you've done to honor her and show her how much you love her even though she's not here.","14":"Strengthened my resolve to become the person she'd want me to be, and to finally feel like I'm finally going to get to a point where she can be proud of me.","15":"I visit her grave and talk to her. I know she's not there and I will never speak to her again, but it makes me feel a little better anyway. She passed in 2005.","16":"I like this. Some people don't like visiting their lost ones' graves but I would like to have that, just to have something to look at while you talk to them. Both of my parents were cremated and my mother has her ashes spread on a beach she frequently visited, but some things happened with my dad that prevent me from having access to his ashes. I'd love to spread him with my mother but it just can't happen due to some legal constraints.","17":"","18":"Stress","19":"Yup\n","20":"It always makes me sad to see how comfortable people have become with getting fucked over and fucking everyone\/everything else over.","21":"You suffer then die","22":"you","23":"Taxes. You cant escape them. Not even on the Citadel.","24":"There are more Juggalos than polar bears.\nEdit: Juggalos are die hard Insane Clown Posse fans","25":"No matter how hard you try you will die ","26":"Life is getting worse, not better. On a global scale, not personally.","27":"Actually the quality of life is better now than ever before in human history. There are less poor and starving now than in the past and the world is going through an 80 year period of peace. WWII was the last conflict that saw casualties in the millions. Deaths from war are at an all time low. Violent crime is down. Worldwide literacy is up. Diseases that killed whole populations in the past are being controlled or eradicated now. The feeling that the world is terrible comes from the 24 hour news cycle. Bad things aren't happening more often, we are just seeing EVERYTHING.","28":"I disagree. ","29":"...ok, fair enough. Care to elaborate?","30":"Obummer Care.","31":"Alright reddit try number three. Im going to kenya to work in an orphanage for five months, it takes lots of money. Im working for that money but would also like to fund raise for it, because I would like to go ASAP. I have written many scholarship organizations, deans at my school, and charity organizations on ideas on how to fund raise. I just want to ask you! Have you done something like this before? I have not and just want to get some tips. Also if you have travelled to kenya and there are things you think I might need to know I also want to know that! Everything helps. This is one of the largest communities that I know and there have got to be people who can give me some good info in it!","32":"Take your running shoes.","33":"Hahaha you are not in the ask reddit subreddit, you fucking moron. You're using the main reddit. See where it says \"self.reddit?\" if you're going to attempt being condescending, first step is to not be flat out wrong. \r\n\r\n","34":"About a year or so back I remember ordering 100mls in 6mg of Tigers Blood from Whitelabel and from what I remember it was pretty harsh stuff, probably just because it was in 6. But a friend of mine told me they had gotten the Kiwi Custard in 3mg and it was still pretty throaty, just wondering if anyone knows if this might be because of how the juice is made\/the container its in? What are your general opinions of whitelabel? I'm thinking about getting a sampler pack along with another 100ml's of Strawberry Pervert because it's so damn cheap but I don't want to get it and have it be unbearable to vape. Thanks!","35":"There's other better vendors for the same price or less.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FreeorCheapEJuice\/comments\/421h4z\/anonymous_turkers_free_or_very_cheap_juice_list\/","36":"That's awesome! Thanks for the link!","37":"I ordered from them a few times about a year ago as well, I remember the flavors being pretty good, but even at 3mg they were a little harsh. My buddy made an order of strawberry custard at 0mg though and it tasted amazing and was smooth as hell, so I would guess the harshness probably comes from using cheap grade nicotine.","38":"Yeah, that's what I figured. At those prices it's pretty much guaranteed IMO that the nicotine isn't going to be as quality.","39":"Agreed, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. That being said, there's absolutely no reason to pay $25 for a 30ml bottle. Imo anything more than $15\/30ml is overpriced","40":"My feelings exactly. I'm pretty tired of paying 24 for 30mls at my local shop, not worth the hole in my wallet.","41":"Have you tried buying online before? I know it's a bit of a gamble that you might get a flavor you don't like, but there are tons of online companies that sell sample packs for the same price as a 30ml bottle at a shop. Then you can try all their flavors and know which ones you like to buy in bigger bottles next time","42":"Yeah I for sure have! I just haven't been ordering online as much recently because of the convenience of my local vape shop, but at this point my budget is beating that convenience, and I feel like I get more bang for my buck online anyway.","43":"Oh ok, just wanted to make sure you know some good websites to buy from. I don't mind going to my local shop every now and again and buying some juice to support them, but I would be broke as hell if that's all I bought from! Lol","44":"I ordered them around the same time and I loved them.  I think the fastest I vaped the stuff was 30ml in a day, and I could have gone for more.  But when I ordered within the last few months, all of it went in the trash.  The sour watermelon flavor tasted burnt even at extremely low wattages with wide open airflow, and the bikini bottom (pineapple upside down cake) didn't taste a single bit like it did when I first got it.  On top of that, it began tasting burnt at 30 watts with wide open airflow.  The mango custard tasted like leaves, I nearly gagged when I took a hit and I ended up burning it off and replacing my cotton after the third hit.\n\nThe only good flavors I had from them recently were tiger's blood and banana custard, but those came in 30ml samplers instead of in 100ml bottles like the rest.  I don't know if it was a matter of bulk vs smaller batch sizes, but I would play it safe and go elsewhere, since neither of those flavors were all that great anyway.\n\nEdit: One thing I should note too is that if you re-bottle it in to smaller bottles, it will almost taste moldy after two weeks.  There was no difference in color or texture, but the smell was off and I vomited after taking a long inhale.","45":"Yeah that's the general consensus if what I've been hearing. I think I'll take my money and try out Blue Dot Vapors instead. The Tigers blood is really good though, just a little throaty from what I recall.","46":"I'd recommend vape wild if you want bulk juice.  It doesn't come in bulk bottles, but it is even less expensive than blue dot and I haven't had a single bad flavor out of the 10-20 that I have tried.  Hell, even their cinnamon menthol juice had fantastic flavor when it wasn't making me cough my lungs up.","47":"Blue dot is great, Northland is pretty good (it's a gamble because they only sell 120 ml bottles), Vista Vapes is pretty good though hit- or-miss. All three of these companies have great customer service in my experience and good prices. I think blue dot is my favorite overall for quality but Vista and Northland have a some really great flavors","48":"What are your recommended Blue Dot Flavors specifically? Prolly gonna get my next shipment of juice from them! Fruity flavors are the bomb.","49":"My favorites are Convicted Melons and Milk of the Poppy. Personally, I prefer their milky\/custardy\/ flavors like Dots Custard, CTC Cereal, and Silly Rabbit. I love the milky inhale and exhale of those flavors and there are so many hints of different things that hit you all at once.\n\nBerry Breeze (berries & menthol) was also surprisingly good, but not an ADV. Santa Cruz was OK. Fruity, but not as sweet as I would have liked. I only had 10mls of Vanilla White Peach Yogurt and Mars and they were also just OK. IDK how I felt about Moo Fields. I wasn't blown away but I vaped the hell out of it until it was gone. I also had a 30ml of Creamy Latte and it tasted exactly like a normal latte with espresso and milk. That may or may not be a good thing for you, but I enjoyed it.\n\nI never really have the option or patience to let my BDV orders steep properly cuz when I order something, it's literally all I have until my next order, so I've vaped everything straight out of the mail with about 3-4 days of age from creation and shipping. \n","50":"Silly Rabit and Strawberry Milk really caught my attention, those will probably be my first pick ups. Thanks a bunch for the advice! ","51":"League is now the main carrier of E-Sports\n\nHow much time does League have until it starts losing popularity?\n\n","52":"About 7 years","53":"Depends of Riot","54":"Loses popularity here, or in korea? because i know a lot of really old games that still have a huge following \/ showing in competitive scenes in korea.","55":"Starcraft 1 + Broodwar lasted for more of a Decade in Korea, and it's still going on with a fancier but basically similar continuation","56":"If Riot keeps the game fresh and updated like now then I don't see it losing popularity anytime soon. ","57":"Some friends and I started playing DOTA around 2002, it's been twelve years and although we switched to league it's basically the same activity for us.

Anyways, in the video there is this uprising against the establishment and there is an announcer on tv telling everyone to chill out or whatever.  But then at the end of the video it shows the announcer had a tube coming out of their back and they were just a puppet robot to control the masses.  This has plagued me for years.  Please help.","81":"A stab in the dark on this one... If it was Silverchair, was it [this](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ShiShrR_nh8) song, Anthem For the Year 2000?","82":"OMG!  Yes.

I've taken a look through posts about similar situations, and hopefully mine is as straightforward as I think. \n\nWe currently own a condo and need more space for kids. Not terribly urgent but we would like to move in the next 0.5-1.5 years. We currently owe $240k ($260k est. mkt value), on a 30 year, 4.75% mortgage (no PMI), no other debts.. We already have our 6 month emergency fund in its own savings account, and have been stashing cash like crazy to save up for a down payment. \n\nNow, we have about 115k of down payment money, and it seems like we should use at least a portion of that (20k? 30k?) to pay down our current mortgage because our savings is getting only 0.75%. Because we may want to use the money in 6-12 months, I am extremely uncomfortable with investing the cash. Is there something better I can be doing with it (401k maxed out, can't do IRA\/roth) than paying down the mortgage? We had considered keeping our condo as a rental but our time frame is unlikely to permit it. ","84":"I can't see why you can't put the full $115k into your current loan.\n\nThat will save you ~$5.5k\/year in interest against whatever miserable amount you are making in savings.\n\nSpeak to your bank about options for rolling over the equity from one house to another. Normally 'bridging loan' or 'home equity loan'.\n\nMaybe put aside a small amount (~$20k) in cash for costs.","85":"Thanks for your advice!","86":"Have you looked into doing a [backdoor Roth](http:\/\/www.bogleheads.org\/wiki\/Backdoor_Roth_IRA)?\n\nGiven your time frame, the funds definitely should be in accounts such as savings or CDs.  \n\nWhat price are you looking at for the new home?  Assuming you're looking in the 425k-475k range, I'd be inclined to keep it in savings to cover cases such as finding a place you want, but not being able to sell the condo right away.","87":"Thanks! I am familiar with the backdoor Roth, and we will probably look into it in future years. In our area we are probably looking at 600k+, so it's likely we will need to sell when we eventually buy.

It had different categories, I'm pretty sure they switched up every time, though I don't remember specifics(sorry).   Unfortunately I can't remember if the game came with the computer, was downloadable, or was a CD.  It wasn't Jeopardy and it wasn't who wants to be a millionaire, it was more of a generic game.  The graphics werent chunky or bad and thinking back on it they seemed better than their time. I want to say the colors were like blues and blacks but I'm not certain. I was desperate and asked my mom because she used to play sometimes as well(this wasn't really like a young kid game) but she has a worse memory than me, natural for older adults.  She thought the game might just be called millionaire but after searching google it didn't seem like it, as all I was getting was who wants to be a millionaire and I am certain it was not that.  I know there was timer countdown, and I think there were powerups, similar to lifelines, but no it wasn't WWTBAM!

I'm a zerg player and it seems like I'll never be able to make it past high plat. I've been playing on and off since release and played a little BW, too (but not very seriously). I did bump into low diamond for a little bit when I was really pushing, but I think I just had a lucky streak of games. \n\nAll I do is ladder, should I do other things to practice? Should I take less time off?\n\nI hear about people who go from bronze to masters in 1000 games, and I don't know if that's 1000 ladder games and 4000 practice games, or if it's that they're just naturally gifted, or if that's the norm.\n\nAhhh!","180":"I just got diamond. I was platinum for a while but then i joined a skype group with a couple of masters players. They gave me tips and I improved. I'd recommend the same to you.

I'll also check out the video.","187":"I'm gonna give this a shot. I think that the big thing is deliberate practice. Thanks!","188":"It is probably hopeless if you keep doing what you are doing. You have to play to improve not just to play if you want to get better. \n\nSo take a step back, look at your games analyse what you are not doing good and try improving it. If you do not really know what you should be doing , watch some youtube tutorials or videos. \n\nFor zerg , you can watch LowkoTV or hang out in Neuro's stream","189":"I'm diamond and I still lose to plats on my new account - they feel about the same to me as Dia's, I don't see much difference. Just mass game if you want Dia, and you'll probably stay there since they're basically as shitty as plats. #ForeverDiamond","190":"you need to practice efficiently, dont just mass games but think about things you should improve in every game.\n\n Do you have buildorders for every matchup? can you do them in your sleep without getting supplyblocked?\n\n do you scout? when you scout, do you have prepared reactions to what youre scouting? (e.g scouted armory from Terran with hellion production I need to build a bling nest, or scouted 2 gas at protoss natural at 6:30 I should prep for heavy tech).\n\nDo you always hit your larvae injects on time? if not why? do you have a bad way of checking your injects? do you use camera hotkeys? do you use hotkeys for all your hatcheries and your army? do you hotkey eggs into your army as you build stuff?\n\nDo you have a macrocycle? As in, knowing in your backbone when to inject and when to spread your creep and always hitting it like a clockwork?\n\nif you focus on these things I promise you will improve and get promoted to masters eventually.","191":"Playing 4000 games means nothing. If you truly want to improve past that, analyzing replays, VODs, and build orders will take you to the next level. ","192":"It is never hopeless.  Grinding games on the ladder is nice, but I haven't seen anything in your post about how you're actually trying to improve.  Are you going through replays and identifying what went wrong? Is that where you need help (self-analysis)? Are you losing a particular match up? Don't know how to scout?","193":"If you don't know what you're scouting, play unranked random and just learn simple Protoss and Terran builds and what they're capable of doing at any given moment in a game.\n\nBut, how I got out of platinum league was that I figured out that getting supply blocked is awful and that I should try to not get supply blocked. ","194":"Remember practice without a goal, is worse than no practice at all. \n\nWhen you practice and your looking to get better, you should practice with a goal in mind. Never be supply blocked for 10 games in a row. Practice very specific build orders. Never forget to build workers. Practice building workers\/units during engagements. Learn new hotkeys. \n\nThere is so much to focus on and practice in Sc2, while playing the game can be fun, just grinding out ladder games without purpose won't help you improve. ","195":"It took me ~4k games to make it to Master.  3 years of plat, 2 of diamond.\n\nI dont think there's anything wrong with where you're at\/what you're doing.  The key, for me, to get from plat to diamond was to actually focus on practicing a few things - like, some dedicated time on custom games working on my macro, and some time working on nailing a few builds.\n\nThen I pretty quickly found myself in Diamond.  Now, Diamond->Masters took less time, but was much HARDER lol.\n\nAnyway, best of luck!","196":"This is pretty helpful, thanks :D\n\nI think the big thing now is I need to figure out what I need to practice. Just saying \"everything\" probably isn't very useful.","197":" If you truly want to get better, you need to learn more about the game. A ton of the skill people appear to have comes from knowledge. Post replays in \/r\/allthingszerg and ask people to tell you what you are doing wrong. Talk to other zerg players that are better than you about the game. Talk to your opponent about why you lost. Play an off race to try to understand the other races better. Starcraft isn't really a game you can just grind until you get good. You can refine your mechanics if you are actually playing properly. ","198":"It took me around 6k games to get diamond. It might have happened sooner if I had really practiced instead of just grinding out ladder games but I made it eventually. But now I feel like thats about my limit for now ^^ Maybe with the redistribution thing on ladder I might barely make masters. We'll see.

I have played 1000 games so far. For me the thing which pushed me from plat to dia was a pvz guide. My pvz before the guide was horrible 30% , now my winrate is 100%. (i havent lost a zvp 1 mounth ago :D ) I would recommend you to learn a build order or two. And by learning i mean sit down , open a game vs very easy ai and practise until you are 100% sure about your build. (for me it requred 3-4 hours). ","202":"ie Why is it when we interact with our cats, dogs, babies etc they respond in kind by looking towards our eyes rather than any other part of our body?","203":"Cats and dogs look at our eyes because thousands of years ago, their ancestors figured out how to read our faces and our emotions. Doing so helped them figure out when they were going to get fed and when they were going to get a spear in the face. \n\nIf you show a dog a picture of a human face, it actually looks for the emotional state first. If you track the dog's eyes, it will nearly always look at the right side of the face first, then scan to the left side. Emotive state is more clearly displayed on the right side of your face (You're not symmetric.) Dogs don't do this with pictures of other dogs, bicycles, trees, or anything else. They only do this with humans. I don't know if cats exhibit this trait also.\n\nThis is covered with a whole lot more in this awesome documentary, Dogs Decoded:\n\nhttps:\/\/vimeo.com\/19472436","204":"The eyes show where you're looking. So if you want to know what some animal is looking (such as whether they have noticed you), and in turn what they might be thinking about, you look at their eyes.\n\nIn time this evolved into having our eyes actually display emotions on purpose, such as rolling our eyes, having shifty eyes, holding eye contact, probably even crying or frowning. If that's the part of the body animals are looking at, then that's where you want to display an emotion so that the message gets across.","205":"Establishing eye contact is a way of determining dominance.  It shows that we acknowledge and recognize them being there\n\nMaybe it's just a symmetry thing.  We lock eyes, hold hands,  butt heads.  Most of the time we use one body part to interact with a similar body part.","206":"Hey everyone!\n\nI let this run an additional 6-7 hours or so that everyone could get in. \n\nThe winner of the [Flash Juice Giveway](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/electronic_cigarette\/comments\/2lpi0c\/tbdliquidscom_flash_juice_giveaway_win_120ml_of\/) is -- \/u\/modaaa\n\nCongratulations to modaaa!!\n***\n\nAlso I'm letting the **20% off coupon go an additional 6 hours.** So if you're looking to pickup some [TBD Liquids](http:\/\/www.tbdliquids.com) at only **$9.60\/30ml now is the time!

It is a good game, my wife and I played through it at launch to the veteran levels(50+) but then just sort of grew tired of it.

I use 100% VG and alternate between 18mg\/ml and 31.25mg\/ml liquid depending on my needs. I like the basic flavor and the slight sweetness that goes great with soda\/coffee\/beer\/whatever. I like that I don't have to clean my atomizers. I like that my atomizers last for months with no problems whatsoever because of my liquid choice.\n\nI've tried tons of different liquids. I've tried every flavor out there. I can't even finish a bottle of anything else.\n\nThe only thing that has ever come close is EcoPure Rich. I order 30ml bottles and fly through them.","295":"I completely agree to some extent, I do vape flavors, however every now and then i fill up a atomizers with straight VG (8mg-14mg). Your right about them lasting a long time.","296":"Yeah I can't get over the atomizer benefit. One of the reasons I switched to ecigs is to save money so it's awesome.","297":"Sometimes, just because I'm lazy.","298":"I have tried it, but only as an experiment.","299":"I do, at work. I like it, very slightly sweet (from the VG), but no flavor\/odor apart from that.","300":"Have you tried it in tanks? I have been thinking about going this route because I am often disappointed in the flavors. I am wondering if the cartomizers will see an extended life as well.","301":"Just got a tank. The liquid is 100% clear so I have high hopes that the life will be brilliantly extended.\n\nAll in all I'm way way way happier with a tank and will not go back.","302":"I'm 20 with no current student loans (college has been free thus far). I need a car, and I think taking out a $2,000-$4,000 student loan is a good way of getting one. What are the best loans and is it even a good idea?","303":"If you can't afford to buy a car then you can't afford to drive one.\n\nIf you *must* buy one though I suggest getting a small, diesel powered car.  If you do a lot of short distances I'd get a 1.5 turbo diesel, if you travel good distances then go for a 1.9.  This is the cheapest way to run a car. I commute to work, 20 mile round trip, but only need to fill up once a month.","304":"I'm basically already paying for one, though. Currently sharing my mom's car and I pay plenty for that. $130\/month for insurance, about $70\/month in gas. So none of that would change. I would just have my own.","305":"Probably not an idea, the bulk of a car's cost is maintenance\/gas\/tax.","306":"yeah, but I have a job, just hard to save up the $3,000 for a car when I have class and other expenses, so I could pay for repairs. I just really need a car.","307":"Just bare in mind that you'll have the running costs + repayment of the loan.  Do your best to figure out how much you'll be using it and what kind of running costs (what I already mentioned + insurance, and probably some other stuff...I'm not a driver) you'll be looking at so you can pick the a car that's both suitable for your needs and within your price range.","308":"true, thanks. I'm already paying $130 a month for car insurance, and that number will only go down. I also pay about $50-70 a month for gas.\n\nI feel fine about the loan because I won't have any for my first two years, and potentially very, very little after these two years.","309":"I really don't advise it. Case in point my brother has just paid \u00a3800 to fix his. Only had it 6 months and it has already cost him a fair amount.\n\nI went with a cheap motorcycle. Easy to repair, gets me from A to B and is really cheap with petrol. ","310":"a motorcycle is an intriguing idea. Insurance is much lot cheaper, too.","311":"Very much so. Not sure if you have to pay road tax there too or for parking but in the UK we have reduced road tax fess, cheaper insurance, free parking in a lot of the cities (Easier too), more MPG and quicker to get your license.","312":"You obviously don't live in Quebec.","313":"I think that student loans are for school.\n\nAuto loans are for cars.\n\nIf you know a decent\/honest mechanic, you could probably find some random older car for about $500 and have it last a year or two.","314":"Well, I can't get an auto loan, and student loans are deferred until I graduate. So student loan makes a lot more sense, especially since I don't have any. And I'm going to eventually need a car to get to class every day. So it is still for school.","315":"Student loans are dispersed to your college, however if tuition is fully paid for, they credit the amount to you, either through direct deposit or by check.  I had my tuition paid off, but needed money to live (rent, food, etc) and the student loans I took out came directly to me.  As long as you can reason that you are using the money for the explicit purpose of helping your college career, it's fine.  Buying a car in order to be able to get to school is a good enough reason, it's just up to you whether you want to take on debt when you don't have any.","316":"OK, you are starting to justify a bad business decision to yourself.  That is a red flag...\n\nLook at it this way.  You are going to take a loan out at 6.8%, not pay on it for a year or two, all while the amount you owe increases...  So, you land a job right out of school.  Great for you!  Next you go out an buy another car.  Now you are paying the full amount for two cars, one of which you no longer have.  Also, student loans are forever.  Probably the worse type of loans out there.","317":"All of these things are important to consider.\nBut, I really don't think it's a bad business decision. I need the transportation, no doubt about it. I likely won't have a lot of debt anyway. I will at least be able to get a job that covers these small debts after school. I will probably be able to make payments on these loans before I graduate anyway, but I need a car to get a better job (my current job is a block from my house, but I can't move up much in hours or pay. with a car, I could get a higher paying job with more hours).","318":"Pretty sure student loans are disbursed to the school and not your bank account.  At least that's how they do it in my area.  Now, if you're talking about getting student and funneling the money someone else is giving you for school, without their knowledge, then you're effectively defrauding them.  Not only is that immoral, but it's also illegal, which is why I'm sure you're not doing that.  Right?","319":"No, a student loan from a company. I would get a check.","320":"Hmm, I've never heard of companies (other than banks) handing out checks for students.  Banks only do so because the loans are exempt from bankruptcy (always recoverable) and go straight to the schools (no chance for student misappropriation).\n\nEither way it's still fraud.","321":"Well, makes sense then.","322":"paragraphs mate! it helps and maybe a TL;DR. But I completely agree. she is perfect the way she is.","323":"Honestly, I die in lane and win more games as support zyra just because my impact in TFs is so high. I really like her the way she is. The only way I see them decreasing her ult damage is if they buff her stats a little to make her a tiny bit tankier\/faster. I like the victor mechanic that makes him faster when he uses his Q, but overall I am a big fan of Zyra. She is a very exciting champion with interesting mechanics despite her lack of mobility in an incredibly mobility centric meta.","324":"is she going to be nerfed?\n","325":"not realy nerfed they are trying to turn down her support aspect.

The reason the passive is seen as useless by most people is because the animation before you can shoot takes forever, so it is pretty much useless early because everybody will get out of it's range by then. Also because it requires you to die.","347":"Zyra passive.  It's *potential* damage is really high, assuming you can hit multiple enemies with it... but with a 2sec windup before you're allowed to shoot, that's a terribly unsafe assumption to make.","348":"Twitch's W isn't useless.

I particularly love the scene where the Dictator dances with the balloon shaped like the world. Such a lovely satirical moment.","382":"\"Does anyone else...\"\n\nyes. the answer is always yes. ","383":"I did love the movie, but the final speech was my favorite part. I know that it was a bit preachy but I liked it either way.\nBut I don't think that anything is wrong with that being the most popular part, it is really good. The scene with Hitler bouncing the world around and then popping it is also really amazing, I loved that part.","384":"I agree, too. It completely broke me out of the movie. Chaplin is a genius but he did have a tendency to be overly sentimental and even preachy.","385":"I think it is remarkable how much of the slapstick actually serves to make a serious point or explicate an interesting theme.\n\nFor example, there is a point when The Tramp is ordered to check the fuse on an unexploded ordinance. As he approaches it, the bomb spins around to face him. He starts running in circles, trying to lose it, but it pivots with him. It is always pointed straight at him. This serves to create a potent metaphor for war: no matter where you turn, death is always staring you in the face.\n\nAnother example: during one battle, The Tramp gets lost in the smoke and chaos. He wanders about until he comes across a group of soldiers, and falls in line with them. It turns out that these soldiers are the enemy, but he does not realize this until he sees their uniforms. The message: the purpose of a uniform is to hide the humanity of the person wearing it. Without them, we would all be brothers.\n\nAnd one final example. After the Tramp wakes up from his coma, he finds a Nazi painting a star-of-david on the window of his barbershop. Not knowing how much Germany has changed while he has slept, he conks the guy on the head and then rushes to report the man's crime to the police officer. Another Nazi. This shows the perversion of German society, when criminals and police officers are indistinguishable.","386":"Well, it was the final speech that got me to watch it in the first place. But I agree, it's an impressive film that becomes VERY impressive when you consider when it was made.","387":"Yes. One of my favorite movies of all time. ","388":"I think it's an important film, but not necessarily a great movie. Chaplin's gags feel stuck in the silent area, leading to large areas of awkward silence between dialogues. Compared to \"Modern Times\", \"The Gold Rush\", or \"The Kid\", it doesn't have the clever visual jokes that Chaplin was known for. \n\nI feel that The Great Dictator is overrated due to the magnificent speech at the end of the film, but I won't understate its importance. It was the first feature film to openly criticize the Nazi's and that fact alone is enough to give it historical significance. \n\n\nIt's a good movie, I don't think it stacks up to his previous work. ","389":"i love everything about everything that has to do, not only with this movie, but Charlie Chaplin.  last semester i included scenes from this movie while teaching a Representing the Holocaust class.  great movie!  of course, i am MOST partial to when he is the little tramp.  :)","390":"It's a great satire. Loved it.","391":"Here's a link for anyone who hasn't seen it \n\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/FPqd_9T5Zx4","392":"Of course I enjoy the rest of the film. What sane man wouldn't? You have great classic scenes like Mussolini getting off the train, the dinner, and the infamous globe scene.\n\nBut the final speech gets a lot of mention because it's still (sadly) relevant today. Here you have an actor who has been a part of silent film for most of his career, and he comes out with this film, a sound comedy. Then, all of a sudden, towards the end of the comedy film, Chaplin stops all the comedy to make an important speech about the need for love of fellow man and peace. He's waking up then audiences to the injustices of the world and to stop relishing in their escapism just for one minute.","393":"We saw this in school too about 10 years ago. Most of the students found it very inspiring. But I never liked it; in fact I hated it. It struck me as incredibly self-conscious and smug.

Azir benefits less from attack speed than any other champion AFAIK. So for example if you get 50% attack speed from Nashor's tooth it gives you less actual attack speed than it would to any other champion.\n\nBuild Azir like a typical Mage. Athene's or Morello, Sorc boots, Zhonya's, rabadon's, void staff are items you should get every game. I think Rylai's should be a situational item, not one you get every game. For one his abilities all count as aoe and thus apply the lesser slow. More importantly though, it prevents you from getting a defensive item like guardian angel or banshee's. I mean you have the Zhonya's active, but once you have the 5 items I described you're just doing so much damage that it's more important to buy a defensive item to ensure you stay alive.\n\nI don't think Azir top is a good option, because his early game is not that strong to bully melee champions early and I just don't think he fares that well against the meta picks. That's assuming you go with the 5 core items I described above, which you should go for literally every game as Azir. Tank Azir is just a terrible idea. The only real utility you have is your ult, you won't be able to do any damage, and you won't be as good a meat shield as a typical tank and of course with less utility.","408":"Yeah sure but my kind of philosophy of learning to play a champion is figuring out how well I can adapt him over all sorts of extremes and then pushing the champion limits on those extremes. So when I was learning Shyvana I even played normals on Full-AD Shyvana every so often and eventually started to rack up a lot of wins like that. \n\nTop lane Azir doesn't have to bully anybody in my experience. You just have to farm. I've matched against a lot of Nasus players who, in particular, seem to struggle since they can't gap close me and I'm just stabbing them all the time.\n\nThe AS marks are just there to help give my soldiers an extra auto early game if they are placed well (which they do and are) as they also help a LOT with CSing since if I auto with a soldier that counts as an AA for Azir and what I want optimally is to find a niche where I can CS with Azir and harass simultaneously without it feeling like I'm controlling *one entity*. Sure, I am, but having high early-game AS helps it feel like the late game where its just like controlling Azir on top of an army tab (my soldiers). Since I play more SC2 than I do LoL at the moment it really smooths out the curve between the two games. So insofar it's a preference I'm not arguing this can't all be overridden by improving mechanics (whether or not this is *actually* better or worse I'm completely unsure).\n\nI'm not sure how effective this is when pitched against penetration, I'm not really a fan of magic-pen marks but then again I play mostly AD Melee bruisers like Shyvana\/Rengar\/Yasou","409":"I mean, you can do whatever you want but I'm just telling you that tank Azir is bad and magic pen marks will give you more damage than AS marks.","410":"Yeah I get that much.

She had a pretty painful gallstone attack last week, and she's scheduled for surgery to have her gallbladder removed.  The problem is, she's angry at us (me, my brother 32M, and my dad 66M) because she feels (or accuses us) that we do not care that she is going through this surgery.\n\nWe (me 34M, my brother 32M, and my dad 66M) have made all practical arrangements for her care.  We will be taking her to the hospital for surgery, bringing her back home after the surgery, and taking care of her while she recovers.\n\nYet, she doesn't think this is nearly enough and constantly accuses us of not caring, not having any \"basic humanity\" whatever that means, calling me and my brother horrible children and regularly saying things like \"shame on you for not taking care of your mother\".\n\nI don't really know what else there would be for us to do for her.  I think that she has an unmet emotional need that is the cause of her anger.  Maybe she is scared about the surgery. Maybe she is unhappy that she is getting older, and having her gallbladder removed is a reminder of this.  Regardless, I feel that we have done what we can for her.\n\nAs for any unmet emotional needs, it is very difficult to engage with her when she is constantly lashing out verbally at us.  I have tried calmly telling her that it hurts us when she doesn't control her emotions and lashes out at us, but she turns it around on us and says things like \"Don't talk back, I'm your mother\" or \"I'm in pain and having major surgery, and you're complaining about my words hurting you?\"\n\nI don't know what to do.  At this point, I am just ignoring my mom until she goes into surgery.

Perhaps she has no idea what she's in for and is terrified. Overall, gallbladder surgery is extremely routine (unless you're obese and they need to go in a larger incision) and can be done laparoscopically. It lasts a few hours, then you wake up in a recovery room hazy from the anasthesia. They keep you there til you're coherent, then send you home with some potent painkillers, most of which you won't need after the first two to three days (even then, the pain is mild then compared to other surgeries). A week worth of recovery and then she can resume normal activity (while being careful of weight lifting limits). \n\nThe gallbladder attack are WAY worse than the surgery, IMO. Once you get the surgery, I feel like you're out of the woods.","461":"Just my experience, but when I had mine out I was in the hospital for less than three hours, then came home and made dinner- never skipped a beat.  \nThe surgery itself was a hundred million billion times easier than one gallstone attack.  \n\nBUT- one sure way I knew an attack was coming on was that I got unreasonably crabby- just horrific to be near.   \nMaybe your mom does, too.\n\nCut her some slack and play it by ear.","462":"Have you tried asking her (calmly) if there's something else you could do?","463":"It likely hurts like hell.  She is wanting some kind of support while she is going through it and you aren't giving it to her.\n\nShe may not be handling it the best way, but, she's hurting and until the surgery and recovery she will continue to be hurting.  It's not some small pain she is dealing with.\n\n>  I think that she has an unmet emotional need that is the cause of her anger. Maybe she is scared about the surgery.

I'm sure we have the technology to transmit that data to another location, rather than housing it inside the aircraft itself.","568":"Newer aircraft transmit a subset of \"Black Box\" data for maintenance purposes. See ACARS for one example. Also where engines are \"leased\" to airlines (\"Power By The Hour\"), the maintainer (usually the manufacturer) keeps a live feed of engine performance so that any developing issues can be tackled at the next available opportunity.

Current regulations require that 88 different measurements are taken, 1-2 times per second. Speed and altitude doesn't really help with much.","573":"Don't see why it would be a security issue to be honest. I doubt that the FDR data would be useful for much. It could be encrypted anyway without a major cost increase.\n\nEDIT: It should be encrypted anyway, so that people can't spoof false data to (for example) hide the fact a plane has changed course or cover up the cause of an accident.","574":"If we consider volume of telemetric data to be transmitted and the amount of planes \"on air\" we get the following:\n\n* need for veeery big bandwith which should also be:\n* 100% reliable (no downtime acceptible, at all)\n* absolutely secure\n\nI think it is nearly impossible or very expensive. Would like to see some professional to comment.","575":"Check out also Mode-S Transponders. They transmit a range of data in response to a Radar \"ping\", including altitude, altimeter setting and (I think) airspeed. Very useful in helping ATC interpret what's going on in the cockpit.","576":"We already spend billions on security, this seems like a more reasonable solution to me. There's many applications... Filters could be implemented which would notify ground crews if certain parameters existed, etc. ","577":"It's just not a big enough problem.  According to [this list](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_unrecovered_flight_recorders) there are only 11 boxes unaccounted for.","578":"I love how people are saying it wouldn't be reliable enough. It's not like they would cut out the onboard recorded data. It would be two copies of the data, one recorded on the plane, the other sent to the server or whatever. There is no reason we aren't doing this.","579":"This is exactly what I was trying to get at.","580":"Very expensive. Remember that for long periods of trans oceanic flight the plane is outside of radio contact and only makes occasional reports, most through satellite systems such as ACARS. ","581":"You won't be able to transmit the full set of data due to bandwidth\/signal constraints, particularly when over an ocean. You could probably manage to do the basic set of flight data from the FDR whilst over a landmass, but the cockpit voice recorder could be tricky\/expensive.","582":"There are a couple problems. First it implies that airplanes are always in communication distance to a high bandwidth wireless signal. The blackbox stores **a lot** of data. Everything from recording what is going on in the cockpit to banking information and engine status'. Pushing this all over wireless **may** be possible today but you need International acceptance if you wish to roll it out. \r\n\r\nAs the plane may take off from the USA and fly non stop to Kenya. Well, unless the Kenya airport is supporting this Wireless BlackBox technology as soon as the plane is out of wireless contact from the tower or wherever you are transmitting this data to. It becomes useless. \r\n\r\nI know more modern planes have satellite hookups however these are not exactly reliable to the point where you want to push critical information over them. You have to remember all ATC is done via radio, cross ocean flights use VH\/UF radio.\r\n\r\nSo yes, this is possible however given the amount of international adoption required to pull it off and the frequency that planes crash where a black box is needed it won't be done.

The film is excellently produced with some fantastic interviews, a wide variety of topics, and pacing that left me feeling very emotional by its end.\n\nSmall disclaimer before continuing: I am what is considered to be a \"free culture activist\", which is someone who advocates for lesser copyright restrictions and greater access to information worldwide while protecting peoples' freedoms and rights. I'm more than a little biased because this film panders to my demographic by being totally about the concept of \"free culture\" and everything that Aaron did about it.\n\nThe film begins with Aaron's early life and his status as what could be considered a programming prodigy. He helped develop and create countless systems and protocols including Reddit and the RSS web standard many years before many people even begin to learn programming. He also worked with famous law professor Lawrence Lessig, another free culture activist, in the development of Creative Commons, a well-known alternative copyright license system used by millions worldwide. His involvement in the PACER program helped to provide people access to court records free of charge with some computer wizardry, and his activism against SOPA, including numerous news program interviews, helped to spread awareness worldwide of its problems.\n\nAaron committed suicide on January 11, 2013 due to (what is suspected to be) complicated legal fears regarding information he downloaded from an online journal database. His friends and acquaintances include the aforementioned Lawrence Lessig, author Cory Doctorow, and even Tim Berners Lee, a leading pioneer in the development of the Internet itself. Throughout the documentary, it goes into detail about their own experiences with Aaron and the ideas he stood for, painting a vivid portrait of a historic and important man in the development of the Internet as we know it.\n\nWhile some or many of you may not agree with everything he stood for, and while I don't personally agree with some of his methods and reasoning from time to time, it's important to remember who Aaron was and how his beliefs and actions shaped the world around us for the better. \"The Internet's Own Boy\" is a competently-produced retelling of his life in a way so that anyone may come to understand it, but a background in basic computer and Internet terminology is recommended.\n\nYou can watch the documentary online in the above-mentioned Internet Archive link, or you can find a copy for free at your local library, an institution that both Aaron and I hold close to our hearts by virtue of being free culture activists. Thank you for reading this recommendation, and I would love to hear your thoughts about the film and Aaron's life in general.","610":"Thanks for sharing.

I was thrown out of my car and landed in the snow about 20 meters from the accident but I survived. My wife didn't. \n\nMy kids didn't fly out from the car, but died instantly in the crash.

Really?","737":"Hi,\nI've been confused about something pretty much everyone recommends a TN 120 or 60 Hz for gaming. this confuses me because wouldn't you want a more enriching\/engaging experience with greater color depth rather than a faster one? I know TN panels are faster but is there any other advantages of a TN panel for gaming? (aside from TN panels being cheaper) \n\nThanks :)","738":"To be honest people talk about response times when the reality is that most of it is snake oil. To put things in perspective, on average people's reaction time is significantly higher than even 16ms ([source](http:\/\/www.humanbenchmark.com\/tests\/reactiontime\/stats.php)). The bigger problem is not response time but input lag, which is the time taken between when a signal is received by the monitor and when it is displayed on the screen. The biggest offenders for increased input lag tend to be more robust monitor pcbs that support multiple inputs and OSDs. So in that respect, less feature rich monitors would theoretically have lower input lag.\n\nGoing back to the issue, I think people that suggest TN just say it because they fall into the fallacy of response times and perpetuate it. The reality is that even the response times that they give you (commonly called GTG or grey to grey) are bogus, as the most important is from lit to unlit to lit again (I believe is the sequence), as it represents the maximum response time.\n\nTN panels biggest benefit has historically been that you can get higher refresh rates, while IPS displays have enjoyed wider viewing angles (not as important in gaming) and a wider color gamut (or spectrum of colors that can be displayed). With the advent of Korean IPS and PLS displays, though, you can get 120hz and beyond IPS\/PLS monitors, giving the best of both worlds.\n\nSo to sum things up, there is almost no scenario where I would say a TN is a better option unless you're really strapped for cash. Don't buy into marketing gimmicks like response times, contrast ratios, air flow or noise levels (for fans) as more often than not the the testing method isn't standardized so they can make some pretty crazy claims to make things sound amazing.","739":"wow, thanks so much :) ","740":"Couldn't agree more with your post. Well said sir! ","741":"TN panels response time is faster, that is, the pixels on your screen light up faster after getting input from the GPU. With response times of >16ms on a 60hz monitor, you may experience some ghosting (afterimages). However, if you're fine with gaming in 1080p at 60hz then I would suggest an IPS monitor with 12ms or less, there are some great 23\" asus monitors for about $150 that fit this description. ","742":"thanks :) actually i was looking at the asus mx279h which has a response time of 5 ms which is really nice","743":"Wow ya that monitor looks amazing, really most people recommend TN panels because they're cheaper.

According to the IRS website about SARSEP IRAs, employer contributions are supposed to be non-elective.  Shouldn't her employer have to contribute whether she does or not?\n\nThe reason this is an issue is that all of the funds available in her employer's SARSEP are loaded funds, with target date funds and equities having a 5.75% load charge(Company is American Funds).  Bond funds in the plan only have 2.75% load, so if we can't avoid putting money in to get the employer match we'll probably dump everything into bonds, go heavy equities in my 403(b), and roll her account over asap as I expect she'll have a different employer within 5 years.\n\nIdeally I want to find out the employer has to make the contribution no matter what, and then we'll just put extra money into my 403(b), or a Roth IRA to make up the savings difference.","777":"I haven't researched current tax laws on this, but years ago this was an option for people stuck with shitty employer plans. \n\n1) Set it up so that all SARSEP contributions go into the American Money Market fund. Money market funds typically have no loads. Avoiding the load is key.\n\n2) Transfer SARSEP contributions to a Vanguard IRA, leaving just enough in the SARSEP account to keep it open.\n\n3) Invest those transfered funds in whatever you want at Vanguard.\n\nVerify that this is still an option and if there are any rules you must follow. Vanguard should be able to tell you. This might be an option for you if all else fails.\n\nGood luck!","778":"THANK YOU!  I think this may actually be an option I was slowly piecing together, but you've brought it full circle for me.  Now I just have to make sure it's viable.","779":"I found a summary that spells things out pretty well, and even lists typical employer errors. Take a look at the section on withdrawals:\n\n> **What are the basic distribution\/withdrawal rules?**    *Employees can withdraw their SARSEP contributions and earnings at any time. A withdrawal is taxable in the year received. If an employee makes a withdrawal before he or she is age 59\u00bd, generally a 10% additional tax applies. Employees may roll over SARSEP contributions and earnings tax-free to other IRAs and retirement plans.*\n\nhttp:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-tege\/sarsep_checklist.pdf\n\nSo it looks like you can probably do this. It should be only a matter of verifying what, if any, trap-doors you need to be aware of in terms of time-frames, whether you can bring the SARSEP account to zero without incurring any issues or fees, whether the American Funds has set any traps for you in terms of exit fees, etc. You might find that you can print out a stack of transfer forms and have them ready to mail to Vanguard the minute the money hits the SARSEP account if you choose to do so... or once per quarter, or whatever. \n\nYears ago I had good luck getting solid information at Vanguard. I communicated with a retirement plan specialist (and I always asked for her by name). I wouldn't take the word of a front-line CSR, however. Ask for a retirement plan specialist. And even if you get the green light, you might even want to do one trail run with a small amount, just to see what happens, before you transfer a boatload, and then wait for a couple of statement cycles and make sure there are no traps.

If you choose bonds, you're \"ahead\" of the people who buy stocks for the first year, then you are even, and after that, you're doing worse every year. \n\nI would calculate the differences after say 10 years - calculate with the current load charges and with the annual fees; and assume 8% profits for stocks and 4% for bonds. Also use 5% profits for stocks and 4% for bonds as an estimate of a worse-case-scenario.

A spectrum exists because the frequency of light change down\/up the spectrum. i.e. Blue has a higher frequency then red. It wouldn't matter where in the electromagnetic spectrum you start, as long as your eyes are able to detect more than one frequency of light, you will see a spectrum of colour. In fact various animals (such as snakes) can detect infrared light. (Though not sure if they see it as a spectrum). Actually, even bats using echolocation might interpret the sound information as a spectrum.\n\nThat said, the Earth's atmosphere mostly blocks out electromagnetic waves of most frequencies besides visible light and radio waves. [See here](http:\/\/www.windows2universe.org\/earth\/Atmosphere\/images\/em_radiation_atmosph_depth_stsci.jpg). So it isn't a coincidence that we see in the visible light spectrum, and our technology uses radio waves to communicate.","946":"So would it be possible to make color IR cameras?","947":"There already are cameras in every range of electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nHere is [an image](http:\/\/rooksheathscience.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/03\/image58.png) of the sun in three different 'spectrums'. Of course the images are false colours, so we can see them, since we would see nothing if they remained in UV or infrared.","948":"Nice, do IR rays reflect off of colors in a way that is predictable compared to their visible color, i.e. could you tell by the ir that reflects or is absorbed by something that it is red in visible light, and thus have full color nightvision? For example did they make that star red-orange because they knew it was that color, or were they able to make the imaging software so it recognized the color based off of the IR rays it was receiving?","949":"I'm going to assume you are asking how they choose the visible colours in the images when they are taken outside the visible range. \n\nThey do that by making a sort of correspondence from the part of the EM spectrum they used to RGB (red green blue). For example, [images like this](http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/7a\/Lasvegas.terra.1500pix.jpg\/800px-Lasvegas.terra.1500pix.jpg) that show vegetation might use a IRG -> RGB. (I for infrared). \n\nThis only works if the original image was taken using a spectrum outside the visible spectrum. Like, if you take a picture using only one colour, say red, then you dont have enough information to map it to a whole spectrum of RGB. Similarly,  if you take a picture using only one IR \"colour\" then you can't do a true false colour mapping. Instead you assign value to RGB depending on how dark the pixels of the picture are. So dark blue to red; light blue to green or something like that. Examples of these images are those heat vission goggles that show heat in red and less heat in blue. \n\nSo no there is nothing obvious or natural choosing red in visible spectrum to represent a certain colour outside the visible spectrum. Though the fact that the sun looks orange\/red probably is because those are colours we associate with the sun. ","950":"Just to clarify, because the question was kind of ambiguous.\r\rThere wouldn't be separate spectra for each kind of frequency. Rainbows would just have more colors before red and after violet.","951":"would they look different though, like an entirely new color, or would it just be a repeat of the visible color spectrum?","952":"Tatuhama had a good response, but I'll tell you why. Color is based off wavelength. Longer wavelengths are on the red side, and shorter wavelengths are on the violet side. So if we're seeing UV light, it's an even shorter wave than violet, so we'd interpret a new color.","953":"I understand the wavelength - color relation, but I can't imagine a color outside of our current spectrum, it might just be too abstract to wrap my head around.","954":"Yeah it is unimaginable. If there's a color you can think of, you probably already know the name for it, and it's some combination of red, green, and blue.","955":"They would look different, as long as we had additional cones in our eyes that could detect them. I guess our brain could interpret them to be the same colour, but that seems redundant and pointless. Why see the same colour when you are expending energy to physically detect more.","956":"I just softmodded my xbox using the hotswap method.

In laning phase, don't let your enemies leave lane for free.\n\nSomething I've noticed that many players will always follow their lane opponents wherever they go.  That's not always the best answer.  Other valid reactions include: 'ganking the opposite lane', 'shove lane and take the tower' and 'shove lane, then back to buy\/heal while the lane is pushed'.

Maia was a young girl\nwho lived with her family in the country sides of Ionia. As a child, Maia was enamoured with the beautiful movements of travelling dancer\nand performers, and she would watch them every time they came to her home-town. She practised dancing by herself after every show long into the\nnight. Overtime she became one of the best dancers in Ionia, moving with such grace that people fell in love just by watching her. However, just \nas she was coming of age to move on with her career as a dancer, her village was attacked. In an effort to help protect her village, Maia picked up \nher fathers swords. With her experience as a dancer, Maia moved fluidly, and deadly, prancing around the battlefield in a furry of moves. Her natural\nskill was undeniable, the swords were like an extension of her body and her movement. In an instant, Maia was able to fend off the attackers. Wathing\nfrom the shadows, Akali was intrigued by this new talent that she saw before her. In the morning, Akali approached Maia with a proposition, to train \nunder her and learn to master the ways of the sword. After much deliberation, Maia agreed, and took off to train under Akali and the Kinkou for several \nyears. Unable to actually join the Kinkou, after her training was done, Maia moved to the Ionian capital and enlisted into the Ionian armed forces. She \nquickly moved up through the ranks and was assigned to only the most dangerous and important missions. It is there that she gained the attention of the \nhighest member of Ionia, Karma. \n\n Maia was named captain of the Ionian guard by Karma herself after witnessing Maia's powerful yet graceful display of \nskill after single handedly protecting a convoy from a run in with a Noxian ambush while on a diplomatic mission to Demacia. \nThe leader of the ambush was none other than the feared hand of Noxus, Darius. After defeating all of Darius' henchman, Maia \nand Darius faced off in a clash of steel. Watching Darius' brutal and savage way of fighting up against the beautiful swordplay \nfrom Maia was a tale to be told in legends. The battle raged for hours until both parties began to show exhaustion. In a final \neffort to slay her foe, Maia focused all her energy into one final attack, but before she could, a new source of power awoke inside\nher. Her swords began to glow, and her body felt lighter. Not knowing what to think of this new power his foe had tapped into, Darius\nmade his retreat, and before Maia could chase after him, Karma stepped in and stopped her. Confused by her new power, Karma took \nher in and showed her how to control this new energy. Now, Maia has mastered her spirit and with it her graceful yet powerful\nstyle of fighting. Along side Karma, Maia has become the watchful protector of Ionia's borders, ready to bring the fight to\nher foes should the need arise. In order to keep a watchful eye on any potential enemies of Ionia, Maia visits the league regularly \nto compete and to maintain her fighting strength.\n\n**\"Those who can control their spirit can never be defeated\"**\n\n---------------\n\n**Stats**\n\n\nHP: \t\t489 (+87.5)\tAD:\t\t56.7 (+3.13)\t\n\nHPRegen: \t7.3 (+ 0.6) AS:\t\t0.672(+2.4%)\n\nMana\t\t250 (+  50) Armor: \t19   (+ 2.8)\n\nManaRegen:  7.0 (+0.38) MR:     30\t (+1.25)\n\nRange 150 (melee) MS: \t345\t \n\nAD:\t\t56.7 (+3.13)\nAS:\t\t0.672(+2.4%)\n\n-------\n**Skills**\n\n\n\n**Passive: Spirit Siphon**\nEvery three spells Maia casts, She gains a spell shield that will absorb **50% of the cost** of the first spell she is hit by and returns it as mana, aswell as absorbing \n**75% of the damage, and converts that damage into bonus damage split between her next 2 auto attacks** (Maximum of 150 bonus damage per attack). Lasts **6\/7\/8\/9 seconds** (scales at levels 1\/6\/11\/16)\n\n*\/\/ This passive pushes Maia into a more anti-caster role, by allowing her to absorb potentially deadly skills and reflecting them on her opponents\n   This also reinforces the idea that she is a melee brawler who relies more on auto attacks to get her damage off.*\n   \n***Key notes: This spellshield is Prioritzed over Banshee's **viel.*\n\n**Q: Graceful Prison**\nMaia catches her blade on the first enemy hit and swings around them dealing damage to all enemies hit.\nThe target that gets caught is **stunned for 0.75 seconds while those hit in the swing are slowed by 25% for 1.2 seconds.**\nThe stunned enemy is also affected by the slow.\n**50\/80\/120\/150\/180 + (.5 AD) Physical damage 20\/19\/18\/17\/16 CD  \n70\/75\/80\/85\/90 Mana**\n\n*\/\/ This skill allows Maia to be true to her graceful style of battle and swordplay. Besides that it acts as a sort of unique skill. The range would be short,\n  probably about 325, meaning that she'd still need to get close to successfully engage with this skill. The slow allows Maia to have more sticking power\n  and more impact on skirmishes. The skillshot would be a straight line, and radius of the swing would be similar to a Renekton Q, so the skill has two parts to \n  it, the first part being that she hooks onto a single target, stunning, slowing, and dealing damage, and then she swings around the target, dealing damage and \n  slowing.* \n  \n**W: Spirit Reflex**  \nMaia flips with her blades, striking enemies she moves through.

With increased mana \ncosts to all aspects of her damage output, it should be easy to manage the power of the skill.*\n\n------\n**Appearence:**\n\nSleek armor, with a color scheme close to the new Karma default skin.

I think that might be part of what makes the passive interesting, that not all spells would return mana, cuz not every spell costs as much, or anything. I think If I were to code it I would include abilities that cost HP as ones that cost mana and have the 50% be taken from that, because it makes sense as it is a resource spent. Might have to change it to any resource spent. For spells that dont have any cost it would just return zero, making that a potential way to add some counter to it.

","1065":"Scientifically speaking, I've always been curious about this. Is it like lightning? I learned that clouds are positive energy, and the ground is negative energy, so lightning strikes in the center of those two, wherever that may be.","1066":"There's a book called 'Integrating Electric Heating Elements in Household Appliance Design' that accurately covers it. The heat being radiated by the coil most closely intersects back with itself in the middle of the coil. If each bit of the wire radiates heat in 360 degrees, the possible solutions where radiated heat can radiate back into the metal of the coil is the middle, where it can not only radiate across the diameter of the coil back to the opposite side, but also to it's neighbor (By conduction instead of radiation if the coils are properly mashed next to each other). Either way less heat is lost to the air compared to the outside wraps, where almost 270 degrees radiates into open air for the outermost wrap. Since it retains more heat the inside of the coil the temperature ramps up more quickly than the outside wraps.\n\nAn uneven coil will lose some of the radiation from the middle and as a result won't heat evenly. Mashing them together keeps as much of the heat in as possible.\n\nAlso, current flows from positive to negative, one side of the coil to another. Current is flowing one direction, positive to negative. Just like the current generated by lightening flows from the ground up.","1067":"It's the middle of the two leads. It's the most median part where the electricity collides. It wouldn't make sense for it start at one end or the other, but right in the middle","1068":"This is not right.  In our ecigs we have direct current batteries, meaning the charge flows from the negative terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the battery.  Our coils are resistors and they have the highest voltage potential drop in the very center of the coil when the coil is built right.  This means that the work being done on the coil is concentrated first at the very center, as the energy (free electrons) are interacting with the resistors atoms and creating heat.  The whole coil heats this way, but because the center of the coil is the peak resistance, it heats first.\n\nWhen the current is pushed through the resistor, it is resisted for the first half of the resistor, with the maximum resistance occurring at the center, then as you move away from the center of the coil towards the other lead the resistance tapers back down because there is less material to resist the current.  I don't know if the subatomic interactions is what you meant by \"electricity collides\", but I thought I'd further clarify your point","1069":"Also, because the whole coil is heating up (even before it begins to glow) the center of the coil will be surrounded with the most heat. Either lead (+ or -) is more or less surrounded by air which is at room temperature. The center coil is (partially) surrounded by other coils, which are also giving off heat, and they will \"feed off of\" one another, for lack of a better term.","1070":"The better term would be radiation, as the heat is being created on the coils, and they radiate that heat to the surrounding coil wraps, this is also why micro coils are pretty standard now.  A loose coil will still heat, but not as efficiently as a micro coil due to the configuration of the coils and all the lost energy into air.","1071":"Get ready for a bath of \"scientific\" guesses.","1072":"Are there significant differences between the two?","1073":"5-10% speed at the same clock rates, lower TDP, WAY lower sleep wattage consumption. integrated volatage regulator.","1074":"the 4670k is over all better. but if you currently have the 3750k it isn't worth an upgrade. it's a pretty minor upgrade.","1075":"And on top of that, you'll need a new motherboard for the new socket.","1076":"Yeah.

","1133":"I know reddit is home to many people who choose to pirate movies - I take no particular stance one way or another on this issue. However, regardless of whether you partake in such activities, I'd imagine that most of you would see the value of some level of copyright protection being offered to works (if I write a book, surely it isn't fair for someone to write the same book a day later and undersell me). If I'm wrong, I'm certainly interested to know why you think so.\n\nHowever, the point of this post is for a slightly different but related topic. I thought of it recently with regard to the Star Wars blu ray releases. George Lucas is known for being very restrictive in giving fans permission to use his materials (so much so that my copyright professor may have even used him as part of an exam hypothetical in years past). The original, unedited Star Wars movies are practically unavailable. They certainly aren't available on blu ray, and to my knowledge, they are not available edit-free on DVD either. This might lead many people who traditionally don't pirate movies to ask themselves: Why the hell shouldn't I download the original, unedited movies? It's not like I could buy them even if I wanted to!\n\nWhat is your take on this? If an author creates something, do they have the right to withhold it from society (legally, the answer is yes, for those who were wondering)? If they have the right to withhold it, should they be able to use copyright law to keep control over similar creations (if, say, I wanted to create a six-film epic called Shtar Wars)?\n\nJust curious what you think.\n\nAlso, if any of you feel reluctant to share your thoughts because you might be labeled as being too \"pro-copyright,\" I hope that doesn't stop you - your opinions might be the most interesting and valuable of them all.","1134":"One, the original films are available on DVD (although they are basically unaltered from the laser disc versions). \n\nTwo, of course they should.  The better question is why you feel you have a right to their intellectual property?  Copyright law is all about incentive for the artist to create.  Whether that incentive is financial, the betterment of society, or just personal expression is not important.\n\nThe same mindset that you hold that says art should be forcibly taken from the artist also allows for the art to be forcibly suppressed.  Once you set up that art *must* be for the betterment of society, then the next step is suppression.","1135":"You say copyright law is all about incentives for artists, but in fact, the copyright clause specifies something else as the primary goal of copyrights (and patents): to promote the progress of science and the useful arts. This may seem minor, but it plays a fairly big role in the analysis.\n\n--edits below--\n\nGranted, this is a legal point, and I'm generally just interested in people's opinions. Many countries hold that the artists' rights are paramount (see generally the EU). I see the logic in arguing that IP should be treated like property, but it often doesn't work on the ground. \n\nIf I create a chair, for example, I can hold onto it and tell people they can't have it, but (in a world free of IP laws) nothing tells them that they can't make an identical chair. With, say, a song, IP allows you to make it and then to prevent other people from making songs that are too similar (or that take pieces of your song, etc.). It is a negative right against the rest of the world, in that sense. Therefore, maybe the price you should pay is to disseminate it, among other things. This fits best under the American model of promoting innovation - you get to make your thing but then I get to see it and learn from it in order to build the next best thing.","1136":">> to promote the progress of [...] the useful arts.\n\nAnd how do you promote the arts?  By giving incentives to the people who create them.\n\nCopyright, for the arts at least, serves not only to incentivize the original creator, but other artists are forced to innovate because they can't just reproduce the work.  (Can't make Star Wars? Make Battlestar Galactica instead.)\n\nReading your last paragraph you seem to be agreeing with me on this -- I think.","1137":"Unfortunately, I think the real answer may be \"Yes and No.\"  One of the problems I see inherent in how copyright functions is that the continued extension of copyright throws a wrench into the balance of commodity versus culture.\n\nWe see our cultural output (film, music, literature, etc) sputter creatively because the length of copyright actually closes off avenues of exploration and experimentation by making them illegal or costly within a lifetime.  In other words, culturally things aren't really *progressing* organically, because new creators have to wait too long for source materials to become available and old creators can coast for the better part of a lifetime on a single successful work.  So we're left with completely disruptive ideas or completely formulaic ones.  In a sense, the middle road is cut out.\n\nMy general opinion is that a creator should be able to withhold a work until they either (a) explicitly release their rights to a work they never asked to be paid for or (b) after 15 years have passed from the offering of the product for sale (my *guess* is that most works offered for sale would find their paying market in 15 years if it exists).\n\nI don't know.  Maybe my ideas are off in left field, but this is basically what I've got on the brain.","1138":"Not a bad question, so Ill try to get the ball rolling.\n\nThe basic argument for copyright is that it encourages the creation of works that benefit society more than the cost of the rights holders monopoly over the rights to that work.  In a case where a copyright owner refuses to distribute a work in any medium for any price, the cost\/benefit equation becomes meaningless and the enforcement of that copyright is a detriment to society.","1139":"As a practical matter, Ive rarely heard of movies being held back because the owners think they are abominations (there are a few notable exceptions here, and everyone is probably better off with those films sitting in a vault).  The most common case of popular movies and scripts being held from the public is to reduce consumer choice.  With the example of Starwars, the originals are held back to promote the 'updated' versions.  I understand there is also a problem with studios buying up popular scripts just to reduce the amount of competition some other movie of theirs will have on release.  These uses of monopoly power are not ultimately in the public interest and only copyrights are permitted these sorts of abuses without drawing regulatory attention.","1140":"You can either look at work as a kid that has it's own life and eventually has to be let go off. Or you realize that is only the case because a kid is a living thing, so the creator of a non-living thing has all rights to do whatever he wants to do with it.\n\nDerivative but original works should definitely be excluded from that, though. Non-original derivatives should be legal for non-profit use if they provide a disclaimer stating that it's derivative and not representing the original creator.","1141":"","1142":"Nicotine. I quit smoking 10 days ago after smoking a pack a day for 27 years and it has been extremely unpleasant and I ended up with bronchitis and am sick and it wreaked havoc with my weight and it is wreaking havoc with my eating and the withdrawal that I went through for the first few days was excruciating. No one should have to go through that. Tobacco and nicotine should be outlawed.

It doesn't make sense to me because cars are big ticket items that cost thousands and thousands of dollars, and on a purchase that large I wouldn't think a commercial could influence people enough to make the money spent on the advertising worthwhile.\n\nI feel like commercials would work better for everyday items (food, clothes, toiletries, etc) because they are cheap enough that they can be impulse buys, and the advertising could be almost immediately effective. For example, if you see a commercial for a tasty looking burger, you might stop into Mc Donald's on your way home and get that burger. Car commercials wouldn't have the same effect, so I'm just curious as to what their purpose is.","1148":"It makes perfect sense when you understand their purpose.

Is he resistant to telepathy at all?","1225":"Lanterns have a long history of having telepathic enemies (main example: Hector Hammond).\n\nHowever, Manhunter's telepathic abilities are one of, if not THE, best in either DC or Marvel. He's already invaded the mind of someone like Ganthet, who is a Guardian of the Universe far above someone like Hal Jordan, and has incredible feats of breaking telepathic barriers like when he broke into the Spectre's mind.","1226":"IIRC, Kyle Rayner has made a helmet construct that block MM's telepathy, but I don't think its canon anymore","1227":"That was John Stewart in Trial by Fire. I can't remember Kyle ever learning about it.","1228":"Am I the only one who finds it weird that versatility is Supe's best advantage against a guy who can create pretty much anything he can think of?","1229":"It's Hal though. We don't use Hal for versaility hehe.","1230":"I totally understand why its true. Just feels weird that the most renowned  GL ever loses in versatility to the guy who forgets half his powers exist from time to time.","1231":"But Hal forgets he can make anything but boxing gloves.","1232":"Whoa. You don't give Hal nearly enough credit. He also makes trains and airplanes.","1233":"I thought Manhunter was weaker and slower than Supes?","1234":"He's just as strong and probably a little bit slower, but not by much.","1235":"Has he ever demonstrated a similar level of speed to Supes?","1236":"in one instance he was capable of keeping up with Superman and the Flash, while Diana needed to borrow speed to keep up.\n\nAnother time, he and Flash were mind controlled and fought at incredibly fast speeds.\n\nHe was also capable of blitzing all of the white martians when they invaded Earth in JLA.","1237":"I'm not a MM expert, so I'm not sure, but I believe he makes up for it with telepathy.","1238":"MMH can shape shift to be stronger than Supes.\n\nSupes is faster though.","1239":"Dude, when have physics EVER been seen in comics?

Wish I was here sooner.\n\n>I was under the belief that top-tier green lanterns like Hal Jordan were easily Superman-levels (containing supernovae and reconstructing solar systems) \n\nSure, but that's considering an in-character Superman though. While his output and variety (since it's Jordan, that's relatively speaking...) are enough to compete with Kal, Jordan doesn't have a hard counter against Superman's speed, agility, and durability.\n\nThis does not at all mean Hal Jordan is out of the game. GL, Supes, and MMH are all in the same tier of power.\n\n>Manhunter was like Superman Lite.\n\nIf MMH has like a power level that's less than Supes' by 1 to 5% sure, we can call him that. Either way, he can always use his metamorphosis and density shifting to one-up Supes (tho I'm in the opinion that this *will* take time) and there's his Martian Vision and telepathy and regeneration to consider.","1247":"\nIdk about superman lite, when J'onn get serious..[KO's Ultraman, who is supes equal in all stats, in a few hits](http:\/\/wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net\/80450F\/comicsalliance.com\/files\/2010\/02\/hdmartianmanhunter.jpg) \n\nDef in-character though, he's about 5% weaker than supes, or just as strong, haha.","1248":"check comment below.","1249":"R1: Look, I know I'm a little biased, but lets go with the power sets.\n\nHal rarely uses the rings full power, he usually makes big fists and hit people, which is why I love him so much.\n\nGL's are capable of almost all the powers of MMH, I even remember one time Hal turned into a fly, which was really weird.\n\nAnyway, a GL could do about the same as a Martian, but J'onn does it more often, and Hal neglects to use it, so in character, I say J'onn takes it.\n\nR2: Honestly, I don't know.\n\nHal at full potential is incredibly powerful, meaning he is using 100% of his will, which is past the rings limits most likely, so he'll probably be using 90%. With ALL the Green Lantern's power vs ALL the Martian's power, I say it very well may be a stalemate.\n\nGLs have Telepathy resistance I think, and GLs have been capable of mind control before, so I won't really count that.\n\nAlso, Green Lanterns DO have Super strength and reaction time. Hal can potentially beat Superman in an arm wrestle because of his willpower.","1250":"What on earth was the context for turning into a fly?","1251":"Summoning \/u\/HalJordanGotSweg","1252":"Thx m8.","1253":"Hi, i have recently purchased a new set of head phones. my old ones were usb so i had never used the head phone jack on my motherboard before. \n\nWhen i plug my head phones into the OP-AMP head phone jack on my motherboard all i get it loud sketchy noises from it.

How do we know how much blood is supposed to come out? ","1402":"Unlike a bag of water, your arm is not a bag of blood.  It is a bag of tissue, with blood flowing through it, through hundreds of tiny little veins.\n\nWhen you get a cut, it's only slicing through a few of these tiny veins. If the cut is on your finger, you can squeeze all you want, but only the blood very close to the cut is going to come out. \n\nYour body begins clotting the cut immediately to plug up the hole and prevent blood loss, this is why it only bleeds for a short time and stops.","1403":"The short answer is that you are less like a water bag and more like a city with flexible water lines.\n\nIf a giant comes along and tears a block or of this imaginary blood supplied city it's going to break some residential lines and maybe a branch, but applying pressure or squeezing the area around the wound collapses the lines.\n\nCapillary bleeds have to wait for clotting factors, veins actually have tiny one-way valves in them to help them collapse rapidly when significantly damaged. \n\nArteries in the limbs can be compressed, and almost always need surgical intervention. Arteries in the abdomen are usually \"incompressible\" where treatment involves shoving a hand in a person and pretending to be the arterial wall, but no one ever has to do that for too long.","1404":"Humans aren't just bags of blood surrounded by skin, so the waterbag analogy doesn't work in this case.\n\nBlood is contained in the body in blood vessels such as veins, arteries and capillaries. Unless you have a serious\/deep wound that has severed veins or arteries, most of the blood you'll see has come from ruptured capillaries. Capillaries are super fine blood vessels that supply blood to the skin and don't contain enough blood or pressure to squirt bloody like you describe.\n","1405":"Well, first, we're not blood bags. We're not just bags full of blood. Our blood is, to an extent, contained. When we have a cut and apply pressure to it, two things happen: we block the flow of blood, and by blocking that flow, we cause the blood to stop moving, allowing it time to clot.

Obviously that's not going to work- no one has the space to store that and no one has the bandwidth to stream that. You could compress the data some without losing any details, but you'd need to compress it to a third of it's original size to be able to stream it on a gigabit connection, let alone anything slower.  \n\nSo instead we use a lossy compression- we sacrifice some of the details in order to save a lot of space. Rather than storing each frame at 60 frames per second, you store one entire image every couple of seconds and then list some mathematical equations that give you the difference between each frame and the one after it. The mathematical equations are not exactly correct- you will notice artifacts (differences between what the image is and what it's supposed to be) creep in, especially as you try to compress it more- but it's good enough for most purposes. \n\nSince the image in the video game is being generated on the fly on your computer, it doesn't need to worry about network bandwidth or hard drive storage space. So it doesn't need to be compressed like the video does.","1507":"This probably has to do with the quality the video was captured in, the quality set for the rendering process or the type of file the video was saved to (wma, mpx, divx).

To \"sell\" the idea to the masses they came up with the devine right of kings, essentially this meant that whoever was king was king because god chose them to be, its circular reasoning of course to say this but there were very few people willing to argue the philosophy of kingship when the penalty for doing so was treason and youd be hung by the neck until dead if you were lucky enough to not endure some worse torture. The added benefit of devine right of kings is that when a new family stepped up and claimed the throne it wasnt a problem that they werent descended from the old kings, the fact that they were king meant that god had chosen them and therefore their reign was legitimate, its a self fulfilling prophecy.","1594":"First off, it was widely held that kings and emperors ruled by divine right. To oppose the monarch or his successor was to act against the universe itself.\n\nAnd even if they didn't believe that, it wasn't so much that they thought the ruler's heirs would do a good job, it was that the ruler's word was law and could back up those laws with force.","1595":"At a practical level a lot of it was just for predictability and continuity. When the king dies his oldest son will (hopefully) have been around for a bit and the people who are important politically will have had some time to figure out how they're going to deal with him being the new king.","1596":"","1597":"Wait... is there not a 4 button on that remote...

After the Predator turns some of Joker's gang into \"trophies\", the Batman begins to persue this mysterious killer. The Predator, finding Batman a worthy opponent, begins to hunt him as well.\n\nWill the Batman be a match for this new foe, or will he be the next addition to the Predator's trophy wall?","1601":"The Predator is accustomed to taking out regular military dudes, he's not ready for Batman's surveillance Magitek and whatnot.  Batman, who's assuredly developed ways to bypass Predator's scope-thingy, quickly tracks him down with his Detective Vision^TM and neutralizes him with a high-powered Definitely-Not-A-Gun^TM","1602":"[Been done] (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Batman_versus_Predator)","1603":"Also in the Batman and Superman vs. Predator and Aliens, or whatever that crossover was called, it's been a few years, Batman picks up a Predator spear and Superman says something like, \"woah Bruce, remember, we don't kill.\" and Batman just replies, \"I don't kill humans Clark\" and goes into the cave where the predators were. So if we take that at face value batman would be much deadlier against a Predator.","1604":"Bats historically only doesn't kill friends and humanoid earthlings. He casually kills aliens ","1605":"What really? I never knew Batman was so racis-- speciesist.","1606":"He kinda is. He won't kill Humans, Atlanteans or Anazonians, nor any of his friends, but he kills no humans. Like in the recent Batman\/Robin annual his solution to stop an invasion by shape shifting aliens was to crash their ship into earth, killing all of them. ","1607":"I'm still a bit confused here. So he's willing to take risks with humans and stuff, sometimes letting ones live that have good chances of returning to harm even more people, but with random aliens he knows insufficient amount about, that are also sentient and have their own lives, he's willing to kill?","1608":"Yup","1609":"Huh.","1610":"Batman's really fucked up when you look at him closer ","1611":"I dunno, but racism doesn't seem to fit with his other problems. Paranoia, check. Extremely prepared because of paranoia, check. Sometimes excessively dangerous desire to spare lives, check. \n\nKills aliens, check... wait wut.\n\nBatman's smart and all, maybe there's another reason I'm not seeing, but that seems like he's not applying his logic consistently and moving them goalposts.","1612":"It's stupid, but yeah.","1613":"I guess that makes him a more complex character... although not in a way I particularly like.","1614":"The heart of his Paranoia is his nearly unmatched Xenophobia. He and Lex are a lot a like in that way. The difference being instead of wondering What if the aliens turn on us, Bats casually turns on them. I'm confident he'd wipe out an entire alien race to save 1 human life. ","1615":"The little text I got from upvoting was Equivalent Exchange.\n\nPerfect.","1616":"> I don't kill humans\n\nHe says, speaking to an alien","1617":"He likely intended that subtext. He doesn't trust anyone. Clark included.","1618":"Predator got fucking wrecked by Adrien Brody's character once Adrien figured him out. Not just a regular Predator either, the more advanced and physically stronger species of Predator. \n\nBatman takes this 9\/10. ","1619":"Batman beat 3 different Predators already in the crossover comics.","1620":"Predator easily takes this. ","1621":"Going to have to argue that one dude. Danny Glover took out a predator. Batman is going to have a cake walk. ","1622":"Who says Danny Glover can't take out Batman as well?","1623":"A Predator would be stronger but Batmans plot armour would be crazy powerful against a non-singular character.","1624":"Batman doesn't have significant plot armor.","1625":"Batman is supposed to be able fight Superman for more than a second, while superman could kill\/incapacitate\/trap Batman at the speed of light from anywhere in this galaxy in milliseconds. Bats doesn't just have plot armor. It is full-plate plotanium with reinforced kevlar-plot weave at joints.","1626":"Batman can only do that with months\/years of prep. Just like Lex Luthor can. Why is it only plot-armor when Batman does it?\n\nThey both can do it because Superman isn't unbeatable. He has weaknesses, and Bats is smart enough to use them.\n\nAnd, while Superman could *possibly* do that kind of thing, it's way out of his character. He stays rather slow, so that he doesn't kill people.","1627":"Personally I count Luther doing it (and Stark and Reed at some points as well) as plot armor as well. \n\nSuperman's weaknesses seem super relevant whenever bats puts on a green ring (~1 or 2 grams) or holds a green rock (maybe a pound?) But I guess supes got vaccinated before he fought kryptonite man (>120 lbs).\n\nOr are you talking about Superman's boyscout demeanor (that can only be used by Bats. Convenient).\n\nI know people love it when a man fights amongst gods but every serious fight should be a blur to Batman, without him even being able to communicate with his team (rendering his leadership and tactics worthless in realtime). \n\nAnd since supes wouldn't kill bats in character, why not do it one of the several times he's been brainwashes, since it would take no effort.\n\nBats suit is 96% plotanium. ","1628":"> Superman's weaknesses seem super relevant whenever bats puts on a green ring\n\nBoth times he used the ring, he's lost. Badly. The first time, he broke his fist punching Supes, and barely skitted by by the skin of his teeth until he could break the mindcontrol. While Supes was holding back.\n\nThe second time, Supes just took it from him. Bats pulls the Kryptonite, and Supes just palms it away and smacks Bats before chucking the Kryptonite away.\n\nAlso, how many times does he fight Kryptonite Man? I'm ignorant here, but I'd assume they are outlier feats.\n\n> Or are you talking about Superman's boyscout demeanor (that can only be used by Bats. Convenient)\n\n*Everyone* uses his morality against him! Come on! Half of Luthor's schtick is this (\"Come on, use your heat vision. You could kill me\", for instance)!\n\n> every serious fight should be a blur to Batman,\n\nWith minimal prep, yes (and they are!). But with 5 years prep, the Justice Buster does good against bloodlusted Superman (though he *still* lost!)\n\n\n> why not do it one of the several times he's been brainwashes\n\nBecause mindcontrol in DC can be resisted by extreme willpower, and Superman has a lot of it.\n\n--\n","1629":"I haven't read every bats\/supes comic, so you've brought up some good points. I honestly didn't know about how the fights with the ring ended (why even have the thing). I still think some s tier should use supes friendly complexion to get close and then kill him easy, and more than normal humans should use it. And I guess telekinesis is sorta weak in DC.\n\nThanks for explaining. One guy just down voted me and asked if I'd ever read any batman comics.","1630":"That's not plot armor, that's Superman holding back reallly heavily. That's in character and makes sense for Superman's boy-scout fair-play honorable and nice approach to combat.","1631":"And darkseid does the same thing with bats because... \n\n","1632":"I don't think he's ever been able to fight with Darkseid for any amount of time. The only times is if they ever have a reason to discuss something\/are currently occupied with other enemies\/not interested in combat.\n\nIn combat, Batman requires immense amounts of prep to stand up to him (and fail) or basically requires the assistance of multiple radon-users before him, Orion, a bunch of S-tiers, and then kill secures with the bullet.","1633":"Even in the Nolan series Batman has stupid levels of plot armor - though Joker does too.","1634":"Evidence?","1635":"Every single time the Joker gets away in TDK is plot armor for the Joker. Batman diving out of the window to catch Rachel is plot armor.\n\nPretty much everything that happens to batman in TDKR is PIS. Not sure if PIS and plot armor are the same thing or not.","1636":"Each time the Joker gets away, there's a plausible explanation. Batman's cape decelerates falls. It's possible he used this to save Rachel.\n\nTDKR is pretty plot-armory, but it's also pretty bad.\n\n--\n","1637":"When Batman saved Rachel, he was in a dive. His cape didn't seem to be helping him. Also after they land on the car, it cuts to a completely different scene. What happened with the Joker, who's still up with the attendees? Why didn't he take them hostage, or kidnap them to use as the hostages later? He didn't kill anyone or continue looking for Harvey -- he just left?\n\nIdk if that's plot armor for the Joker or Batman, but it's huge.","1638":"So my Dad today informed me that his magicjack was acting up so he called a support number. The number he called was the first google result though, an ad for vtech geeks 18883093449. They were trying to sell him a subscription to anti-hacking service, and in the process social engineered their way into a remote desktop connection. I assume they used the default remote desktop client to get in but my Dad doesn't know many details other than they were controlling the mouse like I do sometimes. (I remote in for support infrequently)\n\nWhat is the next step? I can't particularly re-install windows for him remotely. And I don't even know how to begin checking if they left a backdoor to get back in, or installed a key logger. So I just run a windows virus scan and call it safe? Is the only way to be sure to reinstall windows on a clean slate?\n\nAny recommendations or advice is welcomed.\n\nAlso, this is a windows 7 machine.","1639":"You can roll it back via system restore.","1640":"Will that leave some stuff (files and documents) unchanged? What if they left a self starting batch script or something? \n\nEdit: I restored it to a windows update time stamped to yesterday. But am still suspicious.","1641":"What OS are they running? If its windows 8 you can actually run a factory reset (although not remotely but you can probably walk your parents through it).  You're right to still be suspicious, its more of a worth-a-shot type thing than a solution. You can run virus scans on it to remove the obvious from the equation, have them change their passwords and when you are able to physically get access to the PC, rebuild it if you feel its necessary. ","1642":"I take it case by case. My fear with home PCs is that someone installed a key logger, a screen capturing tool, or some silly bitcoin mining software. At work, the security of the network is worth more then any computer, server, or person's salary. We don't repair, we replace. ","1643":"I'd first make sure his AV software is enabled and up-to-date. I would then check if any programs were recently installed in the (Control Panel > Programs and Features) and then make sure the Windows Firewall is still enabled. I'd also look at his web history just to get an idea what sites were recently viewed. And just for safe measure I'd run a few online AV scans and maybe MalwareBytes too. \n","1644":"No software was installed today as per programs and features.

Or, in the 20th century, it came to be used in marketing to denote a scent for men*.\n\n*This is kind of funny, though, because it stands against historical use- and almost seems to be taking advantage of some people's insecurities. A funny example? Jicky, by Guerlain, is one of the oldest scents in continuous manufacture. When introduced, it was not sold as Mens' or Womens', because people simply didn't think of scent that way. Now, of course, it's marketed for women... but do you know who's worn Jicky his entire life?\nSean Connery.","1717":"What do you mean?

How does this happen?","1930":"The simplest kind of crash is a speculative bubble.\n\nLet's say, for the sake of history, that I start selling tulips.  Tulips start getting popular, so more people are buying them.  More demand and low supply means that the price goes up.\n\nSomeone sees this trend in price and thinks \"hey, I'll just buy a tulip now, then wait for the price to go up and sell it later for a profit.\"  This person is a speculator.  When that person jumps in to buy tulips they create even more demand, driving the price higher.  This entices more people, who also want to get in on the action, wanting to buy tulips at a large price now with the expectation of selling for an even *larger* price later.\n\nBut eventually people run out of money to buy tulips with.  Someone goes to cash out their tulip and there's nobody waiting with cash in hand to buy it for more than the seller had bought it for.  So they get nervous and sell it for less.  Now the price is going down and everyone freaks out.  They put their life savings into buying tulips because it was a \"sure deal\" that they'd make more money, but now it's looking like they could lose money.\n\nThe price starts to plummet.  Everyone with tulips wants to get rid of them *now* but nobody is buying\u2014nobody believes that the price will go up in the future.  People try to sell for lower and lower amounts of money just to recover *something* from their bad investment, and instantly the price of tulips is in the dumps.  \n\nSomething fairly similar to this happened with the housing market.  The government made it very easy for people to get home loans, which led to a larger demand for houses, pushing the price up.  Speculators found that the price was going up so there were many people who would buy a house that they could never afford with the intention of selling it later for a higher price.  Eventually we ran out of people buying these homes at inflated prices and those speculators were left having to actually pay the mortgage that they had no business taking on in the first place, often leading to bankruptcy.  The whole situation was made worse by some serious shady business that the banks did to hide the fact that they owned all of these really shaky mortgages.","1931":"Thanks, that made it very simple!","1932":"We all know about stoner rock, stoner metal, sludge, etc; can I get some suggestions on some good hip hop for stoney antics?\n\nI'm partial to the Cataracs (if you're in a dancey mood):\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YlCKoy_6Qtc\n\nGreat amateur-ish video.

I know thats not what you wanted to hear, but if she wont trust you and wont do things with you that you like to do, what kind of relationship is that anyways?","2023":"If she's not speaking to you, leave her alone.\n\nMessaging\/contacting her only validates her behavior(which will only escalate it), and, maybe with time, she'll calm down and come around on her own.\n\nIf not, her loss.","2024":"Thanks for the advice,\n\n I guess ill give it a few days and if i dont hear from her, ill move on.","2025":"Well either she's been cheated on before, or she just isn't a very trusting person. You can't have a relationship without trust. There's just no way around that. You'll always be at eachother's necks accusing eachother of this and that. My advice is to talk to her and say that either she trusts you, or there is no relationship anymore. You'll be glad you did it later on down the line when you are able to freely hang out with your friends and not be accused of such things.\n\n~My ex wouldn't let me have any other friends male or female (mostly male) because of jealousy and I am so glad I got out of that.","2026":"I agree with the other commenters that she sounds very jealous and insecure. \n\nOn another note though, is it possible that she is the one cheating on you? Cheaters often become insanely suspicious of their partners to try and cover up their infidelities. Maybe she is using the beach trip as an excuse to break things off with you for someone else, but she wants to feel justified in doing so. \n\nI could be completely wrong, but it might be a possibility. Whatever the case, I hope it works out for the best for you. ","2027":"Just a couple hours away is still long distance, it's obvious that she is having huge insecurities with his friend and the truth of the matter is that those insecurities won't go away unless you cut off contact with said friend.

Sona ult and Udyr 1s stun, that's it. \n\nI think that Nidalee made no sense in that team comp.  I know that it is Hotshot and his Nidalee is special, but I still don't entirely get the pick.

CLG asked him to switch to AD bot fairly recently after being their AP mid for the longest time (presumably due to his not so dominant play at AP mid in the last few months or so). AD bot and AP mid are very very different roles. As good as jiji is I wouldn't be surprised if he just needs more practice at a tournament level playing AD bot before he gets the hang of it. Also remember he's going to end up going against a lot of pro players whose dedicated role has only been AD bot so there's a learning curve involved. He might be in a slump in general but give it some time and I'm sure he'll adjust.","2073":"Didn't Jiji used to play AD.

You would think that since he was asked to change roles, he'd be playing LoL 8-10 hours a day, trying to get his AD to tourney-level quality.

The champion select. I'm sure you saw the [Im tridanemer](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/leagueoflegends\/comments\/n162l\/how_to_lose_at_champion_select\/) post and a lot of similiar ones.\n\nOftentimes people type bad english and insist on picking a certain champion (which often is a carry-type champion) saying they're really good with it and always win. \n\nThese situations are quite complicated because usually when someone types bad english and only knows how to play one champion, you get sceptical wether he really is good or not. And if it's a carry role he wants, his performance will have a big impact on your chances of winning.\n\nSo what I suggest is; Being able to check teammates Ranked Stats in champion select, so if someone goes \"let my ad plz i very good tnx\" you can easily click on his name to bring up his ranked stats which in turn shows that the person has mostly played AD carries in rankeds and has a 65% win ratio on Caitlyn so you can trust him and give him the role he wants. I believe such feature would be an enormous help and would most definitely make the arguing in champion select more meaningful because everyone can see everyones ranked stats so you can't lie about your win ratio on certain champions. \n\nSorry if this post is a little messy and came out a little too long, I just woke up a moment ago.\n\n**TL;DR:** Make it possible to check your teammates ranked stats\/profile in champion select.","2200":"Now that i read this i think that alt-tab to check leagueofstats could help a little in some matches.","2201":"Yeah, but there are two problems, not many people know the website and the site (to my knowledge) is not always 100% accurate.\n\nLeagueofstats is a great site, and could easily be used, but I'd rather see Riot make it possible to check them in the client.

That said, Riot saw fit to make the Smite summoner spell available at level 10, so if some newb out there is thinking that it's time to start jungling, here's some data that might be helpful for the first clear.\n\nIf you use one of the 10 champs talked about below, you don't need runes or a leash. You do, however, need a specific masteries page, but those are free to create, so go ahead and start one, calling it \"Newb Jungle\" or whatever. In the offense tree, put three points in Sorcery, one point in Butcher, and one point in Feast. In the defense tree, put two points in Tough Skin, two points in Recovery, and one point in Bladed Armor. With that masteries page, a Hunter's Machete, two health pots, and a green trinket ward, you're ready to go.\n\nIn the next passage I'm going to name the champ, give you a skill order, a camp order, and offer some notes. Please be aware that some or all of these may differ from the other jungling guides out there, but that's because those other guides are for players who are at level 30 and have all the runes and masteries they need. This information is meant for players at level 10 (or thereabouts).\n\nThis is not a guide for how to jungle well in general. For that, it would be best to look up guys like Nightblue3, Stonewall008, FoxdropLoL, TheOddOne, etc. who have lots of videos online that can be really helpful for learning how to jungle well. This is only a guide about getting through the first clear so that you don't fail early. More specifically, it's a guide for you to go into the jungle, get to Level 3, and have enough health and mana left over to gank a lane. This is also not meant to be a tier list of the 10 best junglers out there, nor is it meant to suggest that these are the only 10 champs that can jungle well without runes or a leash. It's just something to get you started.\n\nPART A: CHAMPS WITH HIGH SUSTAIN (at 90%-100% Health after finishing route)\n\nWARWICK\n\nFirst clear skill order: Q, W, E\n\nCamp order: Blue buff, Wolves, Red buff\n\nNotes: The route for Warwick is flexible, but it's often a good idea to secure both your buffs early. You get through and can end up quite healthy without using a pot, but you might want to anyway if you're worried about an invading jungler catching you momentarily low. You also might want to consider levelling up Q or W instead of E third.\n\nNUNU\n\nFirst clear skill order: Q, E, W\n\nCamp order: Blue buff, Wolves, Red buff\n\nNotes: Like Warwick, the route is flexible. You also can do this without using a health pot, but it's there if it makes you feel safer in the beginning. You might want to consider getting one health pot and one mana pot instead.\n\nMASTER YI\n\nFirst clear skill order: Q, W, E\n\nCamp order: Red Buff, Wolves, Blue buff, Top River Crab (optional)\n\nNotes: Warwick and Nunu both heal off their Q, but Master Yi doesn't, so it helps to take advantage of the Red buff smite that gives you a heal. So start the camp, let it get you down to about half-health, then smite, then pop a health pot. Finish up, level up W and immediately heal, going to Wolves and then Blue Buff. Getting the Top River Crab will give you back just a little bit more health and mana for a gank, but you might decide you don't need it.\n\nFIDDLESTICKS\n\nFirst clear skill order: W, E, Q\n\nCamp order: Blue buff, Wolves, Red Buff\n\nNotes: Because Fiddlesticks relies on mana, he usually starts at blue. However, one way to shut down Fiddlesticks is to invade him at red, so please be careful at your red buff (trinket ward the outer bush, then check both adjacent bushes). You might even want to consider leveling up Q second since you can put the Q on an invading jungler in order to escape. Like Nunu, you might want to start with one health and one mana pot.\n\nUDYR\n\nFirst clear skill order: W, Q, E\n\nCamp order: Red Buff, Wolves, Blue Buff\n\nNotes: I'm not an Udyr main, so while you probably want to start with W to get the shield and the lifesteal, you can choose the next skills to level up depending upon your playstyle (Q gives you nice autoattack damage, E gives you movement speed and a stun, and R gives you AOE damage). After red buff you should still be quite healthy, so at wolves you can switch between W and Q depending upon whether or not you want to deal more damage or get more lifesteal -- just don't switch too much as it can deplete your mana. If, after the Blue Buff, you find yourself with lower health than you like, you can switch to Q and go lifesteal off the Top River Crab, as well as get some health and mana back from killing it.\n\nPART B: CHAMPS WITH GREAT SUSTAIN (70%-90% health after finishing route)\n\nTRUNDLE\n\nFirst clear skill order: Q, W, E\n\nCamp order: Blue buff, Wolves, Red buff, Bottom River Crab\n\nNotes: Use Q immediately after an autoattack for efficiency. If you can, save a health pot until after you finish the first camp. When you go to wolves, drop the W and THEN immediately pop a health pot, since the ice field helps with health regeneration. Do the same at Red Buff. Trundle also benefits from the health and mana you get from the crab, so I'd recommend getting that before ganking.\n\nXIN ZHAO\n\nFirst clear skill order: W, Q, E\n\nCamp order: Krugs, Bottom River Crab, Red Buff, Wolves, Blue Buff\n\nNotes: A few things to note since this is a new route. Be sure to use smite immediately to get the Heavy Hands buff from Krugs, which stuns monsters periodically. A lot of Xin Zhao players like to start with Q, but W gives you immediate health regeneration on every third hit, which is better if you're jungling without a leash. You'll get a bit low, but you won't need to use a health pot. The Bottom River Crab is worth trying to secure for three reasons. First, it gives you health and mana back if you kill it, as well as some vision for your team. Second, even if you don't kill it, you'll still get health back (W passive). Third, by the time you're finished, or if you want to abandon it because the other team sees you, your smite will be back up in time for the Red Buff, which will give you health back upon smiting. When you get to level 30 and have a full set of runes and masteries, though, you can abandon this and do a regular Buff->Wolves->Buff route. If you're not as healthy as you'd like after Blue Buff, you can try to get the Top River Crab. One thing that's important to note with getting the Bottom River Crab is that it pays to conserve mana.\n\nGRAGAS\n\nFirst clear skill order: W, Q, E\n\nCamp order: Krugs, Bottom River Crab, Red Buff, Wolves\n\nNotes: You're actually at level 3 when you finish Wolves, so you might want to gank straight away. The difference between Gragas and Xin Zhao is that Xin Zhao is usually a lot healthier after getting the Blue Buff, so if you opt for that with Gragas, you should be able to secure the Blue Buff, but you might not want to gank at that point. It's your call. Now, Gragas doesn't technically life steal off the Bottom River Crab, but he does get 4% health back on ability use once every 8 seconds with his passive, so the brief diversion to the Bottom River Crab can give him back between 8% and 12% of his health before taking on Red Buff. However, if you are forced to abandon the Bottom River Crab, it's no big deal, you should still be able to gank after Wolves. Pay attention to the passive timer to space out abilities to get the most out of that sustain.\n\nPANTHEON\n\nFirst clear skill order: Q, W, E\n\nCamp order: Krugs, Bottom River Crab, Red Buff, Blue Buff, Top River Crab\n\nNotes: Pantheon's sustain in the jungle comes in the form of a shield passive that blocks large monster attacks, so he doesn't get health back in the same way that Gragas and Zin Zhao do. Because of this, getting the Bottom River Crab is strongly recommended if you want to be able to gank at level 3. Please note, however, that Pantheon is a very strong duelist in the early game, and so you should be able to secure that crab from anybody who shows up. If you fail to get the crab, it's not the end of the world, just go get Red Buff, go clear Wolves (they do less damage than Blue Buff), and then go back to base and heal up, buying the smite upgrade. However, if you do everything in this order, including getting both Crabs, then you're in a great position to gank. Your health might not be at 100%, but having all three abilities plus your passive shield makes you a very unpleasant surprise for any lane where you show up.\n\nTRYNDAMERE\n\nFirst clear skill order: E, Q, W\n\nCamp order: Krugs, Bottom River Crab, Red Buff, Wolves, Top River Crab\n\nNotes: Tryndamere is a weird case. Due to his Q passive he actually benefits from not being at full health, and it takes awhile to get comfortable with the idea of operating at low HP. If you can do this, though, you should be able to finish up the above route and be at around 70% health, which with all three abilities isn't half bad for ganking (not as good as when you've got your ult, but still not bad). Whacking away at the crab increases your fury, which you can cash in with your Q in order to gain health, so it's worthwhile to at least try to get that crab if you can. Similar to Gragas, you'll be able to get the Blue Buff if you want, but you might be too low at that point to feel comfortable about ganking. Definitely practice this one in custom games to get used to managing your Fury and Health.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis isn't a tier list of the best junglers out there, nor is it meant to be a complete list, so if your favourite champ wasn't mentioned, no offense was meant. My own favourite jungler didn't even make the list, because while he can jungle well with full runes and masteries, he was just too low to finish a good first clear in this handicapped experiment. It's really just some data for those looking to try out jungling for the first time under less-than-ideal conditions.\n\nAs for what to do next, that's up to you. All of these champs are in a good position to gank, but they can also continue farming, or try to invade the enemy jungle, or else set up for a countergank, or else go back to base and shop. Which you should do is going to depend upon the circumstances of the game you find yourself in, but at least it's nice to have options.\n\nGood luck!\n\nPS: If anybody else out there can get their favourite champ to jungle under these conditions, please respond below with the relevant information! It'd be great to enlarge this list and give new players more options.","2225":"on warwick, i wouldn't get E at lvl 3. it's not common to gank pre 6, so your E wont be very useful.

So how can all the \"Let's Play\" people like Pewdiepie and Yammimash make money when they are playing games that they do not own?  ","2257":"Many game devs\/companies explicitly state that content that is part of something that they have produced can be monetized on Youtube and other services. It's free advertising for them, and it encourages a buzz around their company in the online community. \nMojang (the makers of Minecraft), for example say \n> \"It's free advertising for us, and we like watching you play our games, provided that you don't yell for the entirety of the video\" [Source](https:\/\/help.mojang.com\/customer\/portal\/articles\/1389657-youtube-monetization)\n\nIt's basically win win for all parties involved.","2258":"That's a complex legal issue.  There are certain cases where the use of copyrighted material that you do not own is allowed which is collectively called \"fair use.\"  There are a few broad categories that works can fall into: parody, educational, news reporting, among others, but this is generally decided on a case by case basis.  There are several concepts used to decide whether something is fair use, and whether or not they apply to let's plays are incredibly debatable.  \n\n1. Transformative works.   Things like parodies and reviews are covered by fair use because they are considered \"transformative works.\"  You cannot do a strict cover of a song and sell it, but you can if you write your own lyrics and those lyrics in some way comment or make a point about the original.  In a similar way, reviews comment on an original work and are able to use that work, even if it's copyrighted, to make that point.  Whether let's plays count as transformative works is unclear.\n\n2.  Amount.  Use of a copyrighted work is generally considered fair use if it's in small amounts.  Since many let's plays will use entire games, this argument probably doesn't hold up, but that does not exclude a work from being considered fair use. \n\n3.  Direct Market Substitute.  Fair use may apply if it can be shown to not change the value of the original work in the market place.  If a work can be shown to be a \"Direct Market Substitute,\" which means that you can buy that instead of the original and basically get the same thing, it would probably be called copyright infringement.  Again, how this applies to let's plays is debatable.  On one hand, let's plays can be arguably used to experience a game without buying it, since you see the cutscenes, the levels and all the stuff you would see when playing.  On the other hand, you can not use a let's play to actually play a game, which is arguably the most important aspect of a game.  \n\nThese aren't tests that a work can pass or fail, they're just ideas and concepts that could help a judge decide whether a work is considered fair use or not, and even then, it would not be a blanket statement for all let's plays.  They would still be decided on a case by case basis, probably based on what sort of commentary is being provided and how much content is being shown and the nature of the game being played.","2259":"Nintendo actually brought this up and attempted to forcibly have all Nintendo content removed from let's play channels on YouTube, I haven't heard anything about it in a while, but as far as I know it's more the companies are viewing it as free advertising and choose not to do anything even though it's within their rights as the intellectual owners.","2260":"the value-added content in the lets play videos is not the game per se, but the commentary and exposition that accompanies it.","2261":"INAL but the \"content\" is their gameplay and commentary, which IS original.\n\nInteresting question for lawyers, though, whether or not displaying the game's copyrighted content (or playing the in-game music) counts as \"fair use.\"\n\nIf it isn't fair use, I wonder if the makers of the games go after these guys, or whether they appreciate the extra exposure.  To them it's probably invaluable marketing for free, having someone show the world how awesome their game is.\n\nAs a related example, having \"Tabletop\" (http:\/\/tabletop.geekandsundry.com\/) play your game on their show typically (always?) results in a sales spike for your game.","2262":"Most lets-players join MCNs (Multi-channel network) which clear the licenses issues for you (for a 30% or more, of course).\n\nMachinima is an example of this.\n\n\n\n ","2263":"This thread needs more nerd3","2264":"","2265":"Going to be overseas on vacation shortly and I am worried about my cell bill.

Instead, we still have engine directly linked to wheels.

EREVs exist, two examples being the Chevy Volt and BMW i3. The reason they don't do 4wd or use multiple motors is because motors are really heavy and expensive, so you're probably looking at adding thousands of dollars to the cost of the car and several hundred pounds vs using a single larger motor and a transmission\/transaxle. The nature of electric cars is that if you want non-trivial range at a decent price you have to make them pretty light, and makes things like 4wd counter productive.

By my search it would seem that my proposal actually should be the most typical car design (4WD or not).","2346":"FWIW: The 2WD version of the kind of system you're talking about is seen in DIY electric setups. It is mechanically a much simpler system, and it tends to be physically easier for a DIYer to handle multiple smaller motors than one large one.

","2348":"Could you explain me what exactly the difference with the hybrid cars we know would be? Do you want to split the electric engine and fuel engine to one of each for each wheel? ","2349":"Current hybrid cars power cars by fuel engine AND electric engine\/s. Their wheels are mechanically connected to combustion engine. I am proposing a car that has four electric engines, one for each wheel, next to said wheel that just happens to get its electric energy from combustion generator (instead of some battery or nuclear reactor:). Combustion doesn't move the car.","2350":"So you would suggest having a combustion engine charge a battery that powers 4 individual electrical engines? \n\nIf you're using a combustion engine anyways, why would you not use it directly on the wheels? Now you're only losing efficiency by transforming it to electrical energy first. \n\nYou can use the electric engine(s) on your own now as well, you can turn off the combustion engine just fine. It doesn't seem likely that it would be more efficient for day to day use","2351":"Well, when you still use combustion engine, you have to have mechanical energy transfer. If you want to do that for four wheels, it is quite heavy. If you want different wheel speeds and stuff like that, you need differentials. I don't want to list everything but it just adds up and electric car (with 4 motors) is incredibly simple yet extremely powerful solution with much higher flexibility when it comes to stability control and such. You just need something to feed it with the energy... and since we cannot have nuclear cars, I could imagine some reasonably effective power generator.\n\ntl;dr: I would build fully electric car and just power it via fuel-to-electricity conversion, instead of building whole bunch of mechanical components.","2352":"You seem to be describing a [series hybrid](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain#Series_hybrid) arrangement.","2353":"Just to make sure, are you suggesting that a car with 5 engines + battery would be lighter than a car with just one engine?","2354":"* Electric engines are considerably smaller than normal engines.\n* It also wouldn't have things like gearbox, clutch, differential, brakes...\n* I am comparing it to current hybrids \/ hybrid supercars, not to standard combustion cars.","2355":"We've gone from a community of like minded non-believers into a karma whoring circlejerk.\n\n\nTaking a pot-shot at a christian on Facebook and rushing to \/r\/atheism to post it doesn't make someone a better atheist or a more intelligent person. \n\n\n~~Posting a picture of Carl Sagan with one of his quotes and claiming it's the reason you're an atheist is no better than someone posting a picture of Jesus and a bible quote.~~\n\n\n**EDIT**: Rephrased the above\n\nThere seems to be a trend of posting pictures of famous atheists with their quotes to karma farm.\n\n\nWe have more pictures of Facebook on our front page than r\/Facebook. \n\n\nWe have as many pictures as r\/pics. \n\n\n**We have less intelligent debates than \/r\/Christianity**\n","2356":"If you're not seeing it, you're not looking for it.

Thank you. ","2374":"","2375":"Because it's an *estimation*. If you look on a tax form 1040, there are a ton of other issues that will reduce or increase your liability.\n\nDid you get married? What is your filing status? Do you have itemized deduction (mortgage interest, medical expense). Did you get interest income, dividend, etc. Did your business make money? There are provisions for casualty loss, theft, tax credits. The list goes on and on and on. The IRS does not know all this.\n\n","2376":"The taxes are taken out of your paycheck throughout the year. Ideally, they should be within 10% of what you are legally supposed to be taxed at. If your employer withheld too little, then you will owe taxes, and if they withheld too much, you will be owed. Using your W2, you can file with the 1040, noting important deductions. In most cases, people are actually owed money, but sometimes your withholdings are very off, and you will have to make up the difference.","2377":"In April you 'true up' your taxes.  \n\n* If you owe money that means you paid less tax than you were supposed to all year.  Therefore you got an interest free load from the government.\n* If you get a refund, that means you paid too much in tax all year.  Thus you gave the government an interest free loan all year.\n\nSo contrary to popular belief, it is actually financially better if on a macro scale if you ended up paying the government a little bit of money in April.","2378":"When tax is taken out of your paycheck, it's guessing how much needs to be taken out. In April, you file your taxes for the whole year, to get the actual amount that you needed to take out. (This is also where you list deductions, exemptions and what not) They compare that amount to the estimate, and whatever the difference is, is what gives you either your tax return, which most people get, or you have to pay a bit extra to make up for it, which usually happens when you own your own business.","2379":"It means you have your w4 filled out incorrectly. The idea is that you want them to withhold more money than what the taxes should be. This way, if you have taxable income which didn't have taxes deducted (such as lottery winnings), you're refund would be reduced by that amount instead of owing that much more.\n\nYes, it is an interest-free loan to the government. But think about this: the interest you would have made off of keeping the refund in the bank (even a CD) should be no more than a few dollars. I'm willing to pay a few dollars to ensure I don't owe money to the IRS.\n\nAlso, I like having a nice large refund at a predictable time of the year.\n\nMy suggestion you you want a refund is to take as few exemptions on your w4 as possible. I even put in $10 as an additional amount to withhold from each check. This adds $520 to your \"taxes paid\" line on your 1040, assuming you get paid weekly, potentially making your refund bigger by up to $520.\n\nIt's similar to putting a $20 bill in a jacket you know you won't be using for 6 months and promptly forgetting about it then rediscovering it later.","2380":"You owe a portion of your total yearly income to the govt. You can either pay it little by little as you get your paycheck (most people do this) and then settle up at the end of the year if you haven't paid enough (additional taxes owed) or have paid too much (tax refund!) OR you can receive your entire pay check throughout the year and then owe the govt one large sum of money come April.\n\nNow, as I said, most people have money held out of their paycheck every month because of a number of reasons: it's the default, they are unable to save enough of their money to pay the lump sum, or they simply don't know what they're missing. That's because it is actually more economically prudent of you to not pay any taxes until the end of the year. Here's why:\n\n1. You can earn interest on the money if you put it into a savings account.\n2. You can put a portion of your income away for retirement and get a tax deduction for it.\n3. You can put your money into certain investments so that you don't have to report it as income, thus reducing your overall tax burden (you appear as if you didn't make as much money as you actually did)\n4. There are other things you can do with your money that reduces your tax burden, but you can't do it if the govt already has this money in their account.","2381":"Also, having to pay taxes in April is a *good* thing.\n\nIf you get a refund, that means you just gave the government an interest free loan.  If you pay, that means *you* got the loan.","2382":"Another question in addition to yours.

So I am tired of jacking the BVC coils and want to get a rebuild-able tank. Would a fogger work well with higher VG juices? and would the eleaf provide enough wattage?

I picked up the iStick for the specific purpose of using it with an Aspire Mini as a stealth powerhouse, something that it excels at. ","2386":"Yes it will be enough. Ideally you'd want something more powerful, but the full 20 watts will be great with some thin-gauge dual coils. I'd recommend building dual coils with 30 gauge wire that comes to 1.5 ohm. That will give you a range of 12-20 watts and the 30 gauge wire won't take long to heat up. Should be a great vape. ","2387":"Just tried out 20 watts on my Hana and Fogger (1 Ohm) combo, seem to get pretty decent vapor production and throat hit. So assuming you can get the maximum stated wattage it should be fine. But as a warning even going down to 18 watts you can really notice the drop off. Might be worth going for a single coil of some kind.

I don't think she benefits exceptionally from any of the new items. Otherwise late game you are only useful for your utility.","2433":"I still like her mid. She may not do as much burst as other ap carries but her exceptional utility more than makes up for it imo.","2434":"New DFG+ Liandrys sounds pretty good. ","2435":"DFG is like 100 AP, 15% Cdr, 15% MAX Hp and 20% increase in damage, malady is now 15 damage + 0.1 AP on auto, new mastery gives autos 0.05 AP. \nShare of True Ice Synergizes amazingly with her ult adding an additional slow.","2436":"no","2437":"I'm in the process of finishing my first rune page with T3 runes (just hit lvl 20 so I binged on runes), and it's an ap-focused page because I use mostly Annie and Morgana.

Both are hard but the payoffs are amazing. Katarina is also a choice if you don't have mana runes in that page.","2441":"Kassadin's ult is the single best escape (and chase!) skill in the game. Once you hit level six, it's open season on any person on the other team not hard stacking MRes. You can't hide at your tower. You can't run away. Unless you have your team with you, a pissed off Kassadin is a very scary thing indeed.","2442":"I may try both of those, but I thought Kat's attacks scale with AD?","2443":"Shunpo and Death Lotus scales with AP as well. ","2444":"Oh cool! Didn't know that. I think I may try Kat then, or possibly Nidalee. For some reason Kassadin just doesn't much appeal to me. I think it's because I'm having trouble figuring out exactly what role he fills.","2445":"Definitely recommend Kat. I just wrote a big post about it before reading any of the rest of the thread so I didn't realise she'd already been mentioned  :O! Can't have enough Kat mentions though :)","2446":"Same role as Ryze, similar role as Annie: Burst damage. The thing he lacks is a stun, which is what makes Annie so strong but he has a really powerful AoE slow and a silence. His problems are early game, late game he is one of the strongest carries.","2447":"I know this will probably be frowned upon, but I recommend trying Malzahar. He's easily the most fun I've had playing an AP champ (I generally play Annie\/Fiddles\/Morgan etc.) and people constantly underestimate him. Yes, he is a little underwheming currently, but he is getting buffed next patch (and rumors have it that there will be a rework of some spells\/passive in the one after, too), so it's not a bad time to get decent at him. He's a very challenging champion to play well, but very rewarding if you can do so. Unfortunately, 6300 IP is a lot of points for him, even if he does have some skill shots. \n\nAlso, his play style is pretty different than Morgana\/Annie, due to a lack of CC\/survivability (minus rylai's). Still a nuker with a stun, but one that requires some maneuvering to be safe (along with some awesome AoE [trapping five people in a nullzone\/silence\/curse with amumu's ult going is delicious]). \n\nPlus, he is one of the coolest looking champs in the game, WITH MC HAMMER DANCE!","2448":"Malz is underwhelming until you double kill two retreating champs with your E.\n\nWith some proper CD reduction his ult becomes much better asset to the team. Also, AoE silence with nice damage ability? Yes please.\n\nI tend to ignore his AoE \"pool\" skill, but it can hit pretty hard against those beefy teams.","2449":"One of my friends plays him and he's pretty good with him. I heard that one of his abilities glitches sometimes though? Not sure if it's been fixed or not, but some of the mid-high level players I was playing with didn't seem to think so.","2450":"His Q is known to glitch. If you hit someone on the edge of your skillshot, somtimes it will do 0 damage and only silence them. I have only seen this happen two weeks ago, though, during the \"everyone is free\" day. Haven't experienced it since. ","2451":"Veigar, big pay off for your time spent with him.\r\n\r\nAnivia or Karthus as a backup.  I think veigar can work with most team compositions, but karthus should be a little more selective.\r\n\r\nMy 2 cents :)","2452":"Katarina!\n\nMake sure you go mid with exhaust and ignite and last hit like the boss you are with Shunpo and Bouncing Blades and try to harass with Bouncing Blades to get them low. When you hit level 6 use your W, Shunpo on them, Exhaust + Ignite, then ult and if they get out of range use Bouncing Blades.\n\nItemwise, you want to go for Mejai's first followed by boots, Lich Bane, then either Zhonya's or Rylai's. I tend to go for Rylai's first for the health and the slow. In fights you: Killer Instinct >Shunpo > Autoattack > Ult > Autoattack > Shunpo > Autoattack > Bouncing Blades. When you start getting some Mejai stacks your post-spell autoattacks do some insane damage because of the Lich Bane procs. Also, it's good practice to always carry a couple of sight wards around with you incase you get cut off with no minion wave to Shunpo to, you can always throw a ward down as far away from you as you can and Shunpo to it :)\n\nAs far as skills are concerned I try to max out my Bouncing Blades as soon as I can even though I'm going for an AP build the extra harassment is awesome. When you've finished off an enemy wave you can rush towards their tower, Killer Instinct, and then throw a Bouncing Blade at the first minion. If the enemy isn't careful they will be hit by the bounces and because you used Killer Instinct first they will receive the full amount of damage.\n\nMeh, that's all I can be bothered writing. If anyone shows interest I might elaborate further. Kat is definitely the most fun champion to play in my opinion though :)","2453":"Viegar","2454":"Vlad!

Dont worry, I already asked uncle google, but want more opinions and many of them were not answered. Here we go:\n\n1. When jungler is getting blue for mid laner, should he wait for him to clear wave, or is it more important that mid leaves 10 creeps and gets blue asap?\n2. When I am mid and enemy mid laner roams, should I go after him or push lane so he looses farm? I just ping a lot, spam chat and push lane.\n3. Is it just me or does wombo combo teams usualy win in silver\/gold games? For example: Ziggs, Amumu, Miss Fortune, Sona, Malphite,...I guess they dont know what to do in teamfights.\n4. Is it worth ganking 2v1 lanes, and I mean 2v2 not 3v1?\n5. Is it better to complete one big item asap or components of more not yet completed items?\n\nThanks in advance! And sorry for grammar mistakes, english is not my primary language.","2486":"1. If I jungle and mid needs blue, I always tell them to clear first if their lane is pushed. If needed, I'll do wolves first.\n\nIf I'm mid and jungler tells me to come blue, I ping 'on my way' but usually clear\/push first. This, however, needs decent communication with the jungler, who might just keep the blue...","2487":"the reason this is good to push because it would make it more difficult for the enemy to realize that you are heading to get blue and would be less lightly to contest , but if you realize your enemy tries to invade buffs a lot going for the buff as soon as possible is more important to secure the buff . ","2488":"1. As a jungler you should probably wait till he clears wave (especially if the wave is pushing towards your side). Meanwhile you can do wolves or whatnot. But you can also take the second blue for yourself if you feel you are behind (in levels and gold), if the enemy is tryng to contest it, or if your mid is terribly behind (this is also situational, sometimes it might help your mid laner get back into the game, sometimes it just means he will feed it to the enemy, it's your call).\n\n2. Depends on what champion you are playing. If you're also mobile champion you should follow in most cases, but if you'renot the best roam champion (anivia, karthus) you should shove your lane and put as much damage to the turret. \n\n3. Silver and gold benefits mostly from all in\/AoE teamcomps. That's why you find ammumu, malph, etc. often banned. Player simply have easier time following those type of initiations rather than applying advanced tactics (poking, splitpushing, etc.)\n\n4. It depends on champions. If the the enemy doesn't have any cc and you and your ally are cc champions it's often worth. In most cases it's better for you as ajungler to wait for them to dive your ally then go in and try to make the best of the situation.\n\n5. Also depends on situation. I'm jungler main and I tend to rush typical ancient golem\/ninja tabis first in most cases. Then as the game goes on I decide what am I going to build next (if the enemy is heavy AD comp i tend to rush FH or randuins, if AP aegis, etc.) My strategy is to see who is fed on the enemy team and try to counter his build to help my team in teamfights, or if I'm laning get the items that will help me snowball the game.","2489":"in low elo people dont know how to engage teamfights properly as well as how to avoid fighting.  You can avoid teamfights by splitpushing or catching people out of position.  Engaging is alot more self explanatory.  And alot of people dont know what peeling is so if you have amumu ulting like a varus and then malphite ults him hes basically dead.....","2490":"1. I think that if you want the blue you have to commit for it, including soloing it if the junglers isn't nearby or helping him killing it from 100% to 0%. So yeah, if you want the blue you gotta be your jungler's b*tch.\n\n2. Depends on the situation, but what you should always do is warding around mid the usual paths he takes  when going for a gank so that you can try to attack him while he tries to quit the lane or just warn your mates early enough. Mid turrets are very important, if you can push them go for it.\n\n3. More like comps based on enemy bad positioning win because people aren't that good at dodging and positioning.\n\n4. It is very early on when you are lvl3 with double buff and they are lvl1-2. Depending on your laner it may be worth it to go right when he hits lvl6 or 9 cause he gets a big spike of power (ganking lvl6 with renekton for example) while his opponents doesn't yet (lvl5\/7).\n\n5. Finished items provide usefull stats such as armor\/magic pen, CDR, bonus damage so if you can you should go for them. Though if you have issues against your opponent (lets say a mage) you may pick an early negatron while still going for your core damage item then.","2491":"To 1.) You only miss like 2 or so creeps, and given the roles of the jungler in helping all lanes, it would be irresponsible to have to wait for the mid lanes wave to clear while the other lanes get ganked or have to stay in lane for cover to come before they can b.\nTo 2.) It depends upon the situation, I often base it on the lane I feel that they are roaming to and\/or the jungler's position. If your jungler can help cover or the lane about to get ganked is healthy, push the tower; if not, think about getting in a position to counter the roam.\nTo 3.) Some team comps are often really strong early to mid, but a champ does not win a ranked. If the game is one where the team comps account for the enemy comp (strong early\/cc heavy\/poke\/etc), then both teams can have a chance.\nTo 4.) As a jungler or mid, you want to take advantage of a 2v1 over-confidence that the enemy often shows. If the lane is playing smart, provide cover and\/or pressure as is necessary. Ganks can help a lane get even or ahead, but NEVER force a gank. If the positioning or timing is off, cover or leave (or counter jungle if possible). Struggling lanes often can play safe and be useful later in game for fights.\nTo 5.) I find that it depends upon the opponents in lane or how well you are doing in lane. If you feel safe waiting to finish that Zhonyas or BT because you can get out of the ganks, or get in plenty of free poke in lane as is, or whatever, wait for the bigg'un and grab a ward or two to be safer in lane with that seekers or rod instead of a oddball inventory. (P.S. - If you find the opponent is buying early armor or mr, it may be worth grabbing some earlier pen to balance it. Or, if you are unsure in lane about fights, but feel like that little more damage will turn it in your favor; grab that oddball inventory.) This one is a preference and feel based thing more than anything. Play it smart and you wont regret it.\n\nHope this helps. I may not be the best in game with mechanics or execution, but I try to keep my analysis of the situations I watch in other games or streams sharp and accurate.","2492":"Is there anything particularly wrong with not having a modular PSU?

I can't edit the title**\n\nI'm going to go through this in points:\n\n1) We met over the internet in 2004. I had a boyfriend at the time. We talked a lot about life but never about anything romantic.\n\n2) I stopped talking to him. In fact I ignored him. I was by that point dealing with a stalking ex-boyfriend and was pretty stressed out and upset and I didn't trust talking to him. I felt very vulnerable and needed to talk to someone but perhaps not someone who lived in another country.\n\n3) For one year he pursued me. Trying to remain in contact and then talking about how much he loved me.  His intensity began to feel flattering.\n\n4) We later met and I discovered although he was a good listener. The intensity I saw in him soon morphed into a kind of apathy face to face. He later told me it was because I lied to him - which was true, I had lied about my name (because I was young and terrified of being \"outed\" and exposed in some way, and going on holiday which I needed to do for myself because I had just failed my undergraduate degree. He told me he had been waiting for me to visit him and it was unfair I didn't tell him I did this when I did this. I didn't feel it was such a terrible thing. I didn't feel safe telling him everything about my life and wanted my own private space to go and do something to help me cope with failure.\n\n5) I began to feel progressively shitty and more distant from him. He had very miserly traits and he later told me he behaved like this because he felt I came across as 'entitled'. I wanted someone to show me around the city and often he would look blankly at me and say \"pick a place\". Also, our sex life was constrained because he was terrified of getting me pregnant (I wasn't on the pill). He also would finish very quickly and felt embarrassed about this but refused to talk with me about this, so I felt it was difficult to be sexually expressive (? if that's the right phrase) with him.\n\n6) I returned home and didn't talk to him for 2 weeks because I felt anxious about the situation ( a running theme I guess).\n\n7) We split up.\n\n8) I reconnected with him years later to apologize for being unkind to him in the past. I had stopped dating someone 6 months earlier who has gone quiet on me and I knew how hurtful that could be.\n\n9) I was visiting the city he lived in and he wanted to visit me. He had a girlfriend. I didn't want anything romantic to happen with him UNTIL he started talking abut how HE felt and that he was about to split up with his girlfriend as he didn't love her and he was looking at ads in the paper because he was going to move out.\n\n10) He told his girlfriend that he still had feelings for me and would hold my hands if he felt inclined to do so. \n\n11) I naively thought... oh I see! they are more friends that partners! + moving out + not in love\n\n12) We slept together - and he told me that we wished he had never slept with anyone else and that he loved me the whole time. He told me he would not sleep with his.. ex? girlfriend ever again. Promised me actually.\n\n13) Intensity felt good at that point.\n\n14) I returned home\n\n15) On my return he told me I had done something wrong. I had my ex as a Facebook friend. I thought this was silly and told him come on... if I suddenly delete him that is akin to shouting \"you bother me!! get away!!\" and I was much more relaxed about it than that. He was an ex it was Facebook and that was that :s\n\n16) He told me I was incredibly stubborn and \"didn't understand\" when I didn't delete my ex immediately. I told him that was really ridiculous and reassured him it was only him I wanted to be with.\n\n17) BAM! one month after returning home I learn that within 2 days after sleeping with me he had slept with his ex... no no no still girlfriend! again. and again. and again.\n\n18) I was extremely angry with him and insulted him. He basically called me emotionally unstable\n\n19) He told me that he would not stop sleeping with his gf and that as long as he lived with her (for free - that's another thing... he lives with her for free) they were together and I OWED him for my past behavior toward him AND he only did it because I hadn't deleted my ex on Facebook (which he later said was not true because he had checked his diary and realized he had slept with his ex-gf-gf-ex-gf before he had seen this on Facebook).\n\n20) I was honestly in despair. The lowest I had ever been. Up and down emotionally because for some stupid reason I thought he wasn't going to behave like this and couldn't get my head around it.\n\n21) This dragged on for months and I rang him at his girlfriends for months (isn't that disgusting? She allowed this and I did this... I felt so embarrassed and later I phoned her to tell her I was so sorry I did this to her)\n\n22) I had a best friend who was a guy and he was amazing listening to me spill my guts out about this situation - never judging this guy or my behaviour but remarking only it was unhealthy for us both.\n\n23) He could not take me having a best friend who was a guy - in part because I had kissed this guy in 2009 (years ago and literally a 1 sec smacker on the lips! we did not pursue anything). I was banned from seeing this guy. A guilt trip was laid on me. Whilst he kept sleeping with his gf-ex-gf-... \"it's sort of like an arranged marriage\" girlfriend on the day I went in to get blood tests done for a health check for symptoms I had been having for months that I had told only him about. He slept with her the day I told him my brother who had tried to molest me as a child was harrassing me again to meet up. It hurt a lot.... and when I went to talk to my best friend about this and told Him he said \"Don't ever tell me I can't sleep with her, you went to see him!\"\n\n24) So... eventually he broke up with her. He went to live with his mother. I was arranging a trip to the country he is from for work purposes and had suggested we could meet up. I went ahead and booked the hotel because someone a work would be staying there. He told me I hadn't consulted him. I rang him up to talk to him about it and he said he was on the phone to his ex and suggested I phone him later. I did.\n\n25) I cancelled my booking and arranged another hotel. We met up when I visited him for work.\n\n26) He visited me in my country. It was wonderful at first, I blanked out all the horrible everythings that had happened.\n\n27) Then I would get flashbacks.... and I began to both hate and love him.\n\nNow... I am stuck. I can't see my best friend who was helping me so much to join academic reading groups and meet people as I was very socially isolated before and my boyfriend stays at home all day reading but won't go to a group with me... he absolutely REFUSES to go if my male friend is there. He actually acts like I am crazy and says \"how would you feel if I took you to meet my ex? This is how I feel about meeting your friend\".\n\nHe won't see my other friends owing to his 'anxiety' and what I may have \"told them about him\". I get angry often when he announces he has to write an email like it's a major task of the day - saying things like \"I have to wish my ex and happy birthday\". \n\nI know that I am not just \"stubborn\", but I really miss my best friend because he would hear me out and my boyfriend rarely goes out with me and if he does he refuses to spend money on transportation as he is not working. I feel utterly stuck and without a support system. Please please please I feel I am going to visit my friend soon in secret and this feels ridiculous like a clandestine affair when literally I just want to have a catch up. I feel like I am drawing attention to something that another guy might consider normal but he is utterly jealous and calls me stubborn if I tell him I will just go and see my friend. He even told me that he will contact someone on Craigslist to see how I would feel as he needs a female friend. What on Earth is this kind of behaviour?\n\nPlease advise me on why he is behaving like this and what I can do to help the situation.

Also the SPECIAL system is cool, making everyone's play through different especially when  comparing my experiences to others.

It's mutual, but we are both married and neither one of us rationally has any interest in pursuing anything. Luckily, we work in different offices so we don't see each other that often - although we do work together occasionally.\n\nThis is a 2 prong issue - \n\n1) I want to just get over my feelings and move on, but it's difficult. I'm sure you all know the feeling you get when you first get in to somebody else; it's hard to think of anything else, you idealize them in a completely unrealistic way, think they are amazing, etc. It's completely irrational but the feelings are there and they can be difficult to deal with, especially when I'm around my wife and just want to be happy with her.\n\n2) Is there any hope of ever getting this feeling back with my wife? Honestly it hasn't been there since we first started dating, which I think is pretty normal... but feeling like this about somebody else (and feeling like they feel the same way) has just made me kind of sad that I don't feel that way with my wife. It's a great feeling to have. My wife and I have a mature, long term love, but that feeling of excitement and almost obsession with another person feels great. I would love to feel that way about my wife again, but I feel like that probably won't ever happen again and that makes me kind of sad. Any hope or advice here?\n\nJust some notes:\n\n1 - I'm smart enough and in control enough that nothing is going to happen as far as infidelity or truly screwing things up with my wife. I'm sure my crush feels the same way.\n\n2 - The reasons for the infatuation I think stem from admiration for each other. I think we both feel like the other is very impressive in relation to the work place. This goes to #2 above - I feel like my wife and I are missing this. I was initially attracted to her because I felt like she was very smart and impressive, and I think she felt a similar way towards me. But I think that's missing lately. \n\nHow do we learn to truly appreciate each other again? I think that's what I feel like I'm missing and feel sad about - my crush thinks I'm amazing, my wife has many more negative views of me, and vice versa.\n\nWe are in marriage counselling already, so it may be that this is something I just need to address with my therapist, but at the moment I feel just consumed with this feeling and I want it to **go away** ... so any advice appreciated. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

You are having problems with your wife- keep with the counseling. You have a coworker that you don't know well enough to have problems with- keep your distance.

Send her nice texts or call. \n\nAnd.. don't talk with the coworker anymore. You write that the crush is mutual - does that mean you've discussed your feelings with her? Because that's definitely going too far. In order to get her out of your head, you have to get her out of your eyes. It's impossible to stop a crush if you're feeding it by keeping in contact.\n\nIt's very hard to keep the connection going with your spouse when you have small children at home.

Annoying.","3004":"This same thing started happening to me around the end of December.\n\nNow I live in a rural area and unfortunately will lose my internet connection for a few seconds  every once in a while. (Yes yes McDonals Wifi and all those hilarious comments + Don't play league if your internet is bad, yes yes we all know I should move to the big city and get real MANs internet, anyways...) \n\nEven a month later I stopped waiting for the game to reconnect properly. Now as soon as I see that bar and those words, I will immediately Alt+F4, wait a few seconds and then log back in. I mean it only takes me a few seconds to load back in (Potato internet, not computer, thank god) but its really really really annoying to have to do this when it really should just be a matter of waiting a few seconds and then being back in the action.\n\nThe problem I have, is that sometimes when I log out, and then try to log back in it tells me some message about RADS error or something. And then maybe a minute later I will be able to connect normally. I wish I had some more help to offer, just know you are not alone.\n\n\n*Edit :*\n\nI am realizing I have never taken a screenshot of the error and cant remember exactly what it says anymore... Ive tried looking it up before and tried seeing what others have done, but huh i've never brought that up with Riot support... maybe ill do that and at least bring up my experience with like I should have done a month ago.

I know its easy for someone to say \"Go play normals or dominion or something\" but I love competing, and all the games I don't DC I feel like I play well enough. My internet used to be alot worse than it is now and so its given me alot of empathy towards those who DC.\n\nI do not get angry but I completely understand others being frustrated and that is fair. As long as you don't let others rage get you down you will still be able to climb.\n\nFrom Riots end this is probably a very complicated issue.

They have stated many times already that they are trying to improve everyone's connections to their servers using various methods. \n\nNow I know this solution is coming Soon^Tm but im willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that it is being looked into along with any other connection issues. Just the fact that neither of us can recall a statement specifically about this does not mean that its not being looked into.\n\nHey who knows, maybe DJ Sona as well as the recent influx of skins is a secret plan to bring RitoNet, a Riot network into all our homes specifically for gaming :) (Oh and to assert their already evident control of the world, but thats secondary.

So I looked, and it seems I have the wrong bit rate or something (fairly illiterate when it comes to stuff like this) and I need to convert the WAV file to one with the correct bit rate or kHz or something. However, I cannot find any programs or guides for this sort of thing.\n\nEdit: I have CD-RW's [](\/solved)","3015":"First, a word of warning, not all CD players will read CD-RWs.\n\nThe CD player in question will also matter since newer players can read\/play mp3 files, but since you are trying to convert them I will just go with it is an old\/limited CD player that doesn't play mp3s.\n\nOkay, onto burning. It can depend on what software you are using, but in most cases the program will do the work of converting the songs from mp3 to the appropriate WAV configuration. If you are using a particular program, let me know, but for most of my light burning (it has been a while since I have actually burned a disc), I use the free version of [Ashampoo Burning Studio 6](https:\/\/www.ashampoo.com\/en\/usd\/pin\/0710\/Offline\/Ashampoo-Burning-Studio-6).\n\nTo burn a music CD using this program you:\n\n1. Start the program (this assumes you have downloaded and installed it first)\n2. Select the \"Burn or Rip Music\" category\n3. Select the \"Create an Audio CD\" option (description: can be played on normal CD players)\n4. Click the \"Add\" button in the upper right\n5. Navigate to your mp3s\n6. double-click or click+add your songs to add them to the CD. You will notice the timer on the bottom fill blue for the amount of CD you are using (it depends on the disc, but it should be limited to about 80 minutes of music. If you go over that time allotment then it will go into the red, but it will warn you about this and won't allow you to proceed.\n7. when you have the disc in order, click Next\n8. Select the CD Writer drive, put in your blank disc and...well, sorry, I am at work and don't have access to blanks to \"test\" the remainder, but look at the \"change options\" and set the speed to something less than full speed.\n9. Click Write\n10. Wait while it burns (a couple of minutes, depends on burn speed)\n11. Test the disc in the CD player.\n\nMost burning programs will follow a similar pattern of how to do this, this is just the one I use and had in front of me to write the guide.\n\nSome will either allow you to edit the track information or will simply pull the information for the ID3 tag - this information can be read by some CD players and will be the displayed text while the song is playing - so if it looks weird on the CD player, this may be the reason.","3016":"Thanks a lot. I was testing the CDs on a very old CD player assuming it would read CDs the same as a new one. The CD player I want to use is 5 years old at most and I won't have access to it for another day, but I'm going to guess that it's going to be more accepting of CD types. \n\nThanks again, your instructions clarified a lot of things for me, and the program reported working fine, whereas the program I was using, InfraRecorder, couldn't finish burning a CD without an error. [](\/solution)","3017":"If worse comes to worse blank CDs are rather cheap, so you could go get a small pack of those for a few bucks. The CD player may work, it may not, but that one is new enough that it is a good chance it will work, It's a good program, like I said, I haven't used it a lot lately, but it still works when I need it to. Slowing down the burn speed should help reducer errors.\n\nBest of luck and let me know if you have any other questions.","3018":"http:\/\/www.google.com\/#hl=en&gs_nf=1&pq=mp3%20cd&cp=9&gs_id=gx&xhr=t&q=convert+mp3+to+cd&pf=p&safe=off&biw=1440&bih=683&sclient=psy-ab&oq=convert+m+cd&gs_l=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&fp=71e82cc23c1cc163\n\nAt least attempt to search google first.\n\nYou might also have issues with your media.

And air pollution has been said to have a yellowing effect on the eyes, but how to keep them white?","3022":"I have noticed that when i brush my teeth they seem more yellow than when i look at them every day; that's because ambient lighting is different. If your lightbulbs are *really* yellow that might give you the wrong idea. just a thing to be wary of.  \nSo, for example, if you see someone everyday and you notice that their teeth are white, and then later when you brush your teeth right below a yellow-ish lamp they will look yellow.  \n**Tl:dr: lighting might play a role when you look at your teeth, so be wary of that**","3023":"That's a good point as I have noticed my teeth would be \"less yellow\" sometimes.     \n\nHere are some photos I just took in natural daylight.     \nThe first is a [color comparison with yellow cheddar cheese](http:\/\/imgur.com\/4JM04r3).    \nThe second is a [color comparison with a white piece of paper](http:\/\/imgur.com\/x8w1Ghd).     \n\nI'd love to make my teeth and eyes whiter. Bleaching seems too temporary and harsh, maybe there's a more natural solution? I already don't smoke or drink alcohol or coffee or tea. ","3024":"I, E. G., have natural more yellow teeth. That's caused by the fact, that I got a thick illness as a baby and had to take strong medicine, which made my teeth go a bit yellow.

","3025":"So basically we have been seeing each other for about a month now but, she doesn't want to make it \"official\" AKA boyfriend and girlfriend. I have brought it up before and told her that it bothers me. \n\nHer reasoning is that she has never had an actual \"boyfriend\" before and that her past relationships have messed with her emotions. She says she doesn't want to be with anyone else and she doesn't want me with anyone else so basically we are a couple but, she doesn't want the titles that go along with it. \n\nThis really bothers me though. To me it feels like she doesn't want anyone to know we are together. To me this feels like she just wants to be with me until she finds something better. I feel like not having the title will make this easier for her.\n\nI really like and care about this girl and I want the whole world to know we are together. Am I just being paranoid? Should I just let it go or should I bring it up again and risk ruining what we do have? I have never come across this situation before so I really don't know what to do. Any information will help. Maybe I'm just not properly seeing her perspective. \n\nI will be happy to answer any questions to help clarify this issue.\n\n-----\n\nTL;DR: We have been \"together\" for about a month now but, she doesn't want to make it official and this really bothers me.","3026":"After just a month, and you being exclusive, I would not worry for now. Titles mean less than behaviour, and if it is otherwise going well u;d go with it for a while. If in a couple of months there is no development i might be more concerned, but not after a few weeks. ","3027":"It is going well. Pretty much everything she does shows that she cares. I guess I'm just being paranoid. Thanks for the advice.","3028":"Don't push too hard- it often comes off as needy.\n\nIt sounds like the actual relationship is progressing just fine and all you are upset about is how you label it?\n\nLet it go- a month is very little time in the grand scheme of things.","3029":"Yeah. It just makes me nervous because I have never been in this situation before. I guess I will just give it more time for now.","3030":"The silly title \"boyfriend\" or \"girlfriend\" only imparts as much signifigance as one is willing to put into it. If you guys are happy and clearly exclusive, I wouldn't sweat it after a month. 3 months down the line though...","3031":"Of course it's up to you to decide if the title is extremely important after a month, but like other posters have said, I don't think you should worry too much right now.\n\nMy boyfriend of almost 2 years and I went 5 months before finally becoming \"official\" and I dealt with the same uncomfortable feelings you're dealing with. It's hard because it seems less secure, and you just want to know if it's worth the wait. After 2 months of hooking up with my guy, I asked him what he thought about dating. We decided to hold off on that and keep doing what we were doing. 2 months later, we moved into this no-title-but-we-won't-hook-up-with-anyone-else stage, and I felt good about going with the flow. It was nice that we waited, and finally, month after that, he asked if I would officially be his girlfriend.\n\n\nNow, granted, 5 months of this uncertainty is kind of a long time, and it gets tiring, frustrating, etc. So I wouldn't necessarily recommend waiting that long, but again, it's up to you. What I'm trying to impart, though, is that you should try not to get overly anxious about this after just a month. Go with the flow, enjoy her company, and get to know her more. Treat her like you WANT to treat her and don't think too much about a title or a lack thereof. \n\nIf she never wants a title, that's going to be difficult. But it might be a good idea to just sit down and say, hey, I would love to be considered your boyfriend someday soon, but I understand why you'd like to wait. See how she gauges something like that. You don't want to jump into a territory with someone who won't ever consider becoming official, but it's okay to allow her to take (a reasonable) amount of time with that. \n\nAnd try not to overthink it. I don't know your girl but I don't think that she's looking for something better and keeping you on a string. I think she's just taking her time, testing the water, and getting to know you and enjoy you're time together before making a big decision.\n\nGood luck! ","3032":"Thank you very much. It's nice to know someone else has been in this situation before. ","3033":"I definitely disagree. It's been ONE month. She probably just wants to make sure she won't get screwed over.","3034":"I know there were ideas of flight before the Wright Brothers, but did kids, or even scientists, mess around with making paper glide before the wide spread idea of airplanes?","3035":"Hang Gliding was a thing well before the Wright Brothers:\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Otto_Lilienthal\n\n","3036":"They did! \n\nIn this episode of Toy Stories:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.dailymotion.com\/video\/xw66wd_new-james-may-s-toy-stories-flight-club_shortfilms\n\nJames May goes to an old school and finds exactly this - paper airplanes from hundreds of years ago.

Our catalog page does have links to our social media, and so if patrons click them they can get out to the public Internet and start using the machine like a general purpose computer. We have many dedicated PCs for that purpose, so we'd rather be able to dedicate these machines for catalog only. So if we could have it so links either simply refreshed the page or redirected to the home page, that'd be ideal. \n\nWe're using Windows 7 x64 and Internet Explorer 11 (planning for Windows 10 later this year), and the user account is quite locked down already, but the browser isn't yet, at least in terms of pages viewable. Currently the browser launches the catalog page in kiosk mode at startup and, via a Powershell script, re-launches whenever it is closed. \n\nWhat I've found on my own include using a [dummy proxy](http:\/\/www.makeuseof.com\/tag\/block-windows-internet-explorer-accessing-internet\/), which results in a pretty ugly screen when clicking links, and [Content Advisor](http:\/\/www.guidingtech.com\/3274\/block-certain-websites-internet-explorer\/), which looks promising, but the option is simply not in the Internet Options panel...

And thanks in advance for any and all replies!\n\n#UPDATE 29 May 2016\n\nNot sure why I took so long to get back to this, but better late than never. The lockdowns are now provided via Firefox, using extensions [mKiosk](https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/mkiosk\/) and [BlockSite](https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/blocksite\/). \n\nPowerShell script **kiosk_firefox.ps1** (runs at deployment time as part of our MDT deployment):\n\n\n    #If Firefox is installed, don't install it again\n    if (test-path \"c:\\program files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox\") {\n    \n    write-host \"Firefox is installed\"\n    \n    }\n    #If Firefox is not installed, install it\n    else {\n    Start-Process -FilePath \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\firefox_46.exe\" -ArgumentList \"\/silent\"\n    sleep 10\n    }\n    \n    #Install Extensions & Settings\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\cck2\\firefox\\*\" \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox\\\" -recurse -force \n    \nSo that essentially runs an offline installer of Firefox 46, and then copies over the folder that has the CCK2 customizations (Firefox settings, extension installs, extension settings). The reason I can't use a regular online installer for it is because CCK2 configurations are version-specific, so it has to be the version that I used to create the CCK2.cfg (in this case, 46) when I copy over the CCK2 files. When it updates overnight as part of our nightly Ninite Pro deployment, the settings seem to be fine. But it has to start out at the same version. \n\nThe real magic is generated by CCK2. The wizard is pretty straight-forward when using it to configure various Firefox settings. I downloaded the .xpi files for BlockSite and mKiosk from Firefox's [Add-On](https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/) page using a different browser, and pointing CCK2 to them. The real trick here is getting the specific settings for the extensions to stick. I basically went through all of the settings on one machine, then found the **prefs.js** file, and carefully copied each line into the CCK2's preferences tab:\n    \n      \"preferences\": {\n        \"extensions.BlockSite.authenticate\": {\n          \"value\": false,\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.BlockSite.enabled\": {\n          \"value\": true,\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.BlockSite.listtype\": {\n          \"value\": \"whitelistRadio\",\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.BlockSite.removeLinks\": {\n          \"value\": false,\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.BlockSite.showWarning\": {\n          \"value\": false,\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.BlockSite.whitelist\": {\n          \"value\": \"www.siteone.org|||*.sitetwo.org|||*.sitethree.com|||catalog.siteone.org|||sitefour.com\/page|||*.sitefive.com|||javascript:*|||siteone.sitesix.info\",\n    \t  \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.BlockSite.whitelistDesc\": {\n          \"value\": \"|||||||||||||||\",\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.mkiosk.admin.lockpwd\": {\n          \"value\": true,\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.mkiosk.admin.passwd\": {\n          \"value\": \"[REDACTED]\",\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.mkiosk.bkp.ori.javascript.enabled\": {\n          \"value\": true,\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.mkiosk.config.firstrun\": {\n          \"value\": false,\n          \"userset\": true\n        }\n      }\n    };    \n\nWorks pretty well. In order to update any changes (because of course people discover pages that need added to the whitelist), I just need to update the setting manually one one of the machines, then copy the prefs.js file from that machine to the DFS share and then out to each of the others. The unfortunate part of this process is that it seems Firefox generates the directory for the prefs.js file on a per-machine basis.

We have the PCs reboot every night 30 minutes after closing, so that takes care of the that. ","3038":"You might be overthinking the problem. If there's only one site (the library catalog) that needs to be accessed simply map the IP in the HOST file and then remove all DNS servers from the network adapter.\n\n\nThat way unless someone knows the IP of a web site they can't get to it. Also if you want to be really sneaky re-map all common sites (Facebook Google etc.) to 127.0.0.1\n\nThis has a list of common ones:\n\nhttps:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/socialnetblock\/files\/","3039":"I like it. However the issue is not that they are typing the address in (the address bar is disabled), it's that our library website has links to the social media sites. I implemented the hosts file on my test machine and it does work for the generic page (facebook.com) but not the links on our website (facebook.com\/our_library_name). ","3040":"Have you disabled dns on your test machine?","3041":"\/u\/actuallychrisgillen has probably the best solution. Whitelisting is vastly more effective than blacklisting.\n\nAdding to that, if you just want people to access the web browser, you can run Google Chrome with the `--kiosk` option to make it full-screen. People wouldn't even see the taskbar or the address bar, so it'd be a lot harder to even try to go to non-local sites, or do any other non-approved things.","3042":"We do use internet explorer with the `-k` option which hides all elements of the browser, but our issue is with links. ","3043":"\/u\/actuallychrisgillen 's solution should work, assuming you've properly disabled DNS (and made sure there's no stale DNS cache entries after disabling it).\n\nThat said, you mentioned \"ugly screen when clicking links\" for your dummy proxy solution.  There's two ways to fix that:  \nA. Get an actual proxy, that simply redirects all \"outside\" queries to the catalog homepage; or,  \nB. Get Firefox, and 2 addons: one for a kiosk mode, and one that either rewrites URL's or strips links.  At a glance, it looks like [mKiosk](https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-us\/firefox\/addon\/mkiosk\/) is the best kiosk addon at the moment, and [BlockSite](https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-us\/firefox\/addon\/blocksite\/) will make the unwanted links unclickable.","3044":"Been chewing on this setup. I like it so far, with mKiosk's passworded settings and BlockSite's ability to simply remove links that we don't want. I think this is the solution I was looking for. Wish it was without extra software, but this definitely works. Now to try to get it deployable....","3045":"Good to hear it looks viable to you.  Regarding deployment, I haven't used it myself, but [FrontMotion](http:\/\/www.frontmotion.com\/) has some stuff for Firefox MSI's and management with Group Policy.  Perhaps something there would be useful for you.","3046":"Oh Firefox is easy to deploy and configure, the issue is the extension settings (password for Kiosk, whitelist for BlockSite). Can't find anything in the registry or program directory for that. ","3047":"Ah.  While the settings for extensions generally reside with all other user settings (in the user-profile-specific prefs.js file), you can set them other ways, including by setting default prefs in the program directory.\n\nThe [Firefox Enterprise Deployment guide](https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/Firefox\/Enterprise_deployment) has more detail, but you'll basically want to:\n\n1. Get the settings working on one machine.\n2. Copy the relevant prefs lines from the appropriate file (probably *%appdata%\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\PROFILENAMEHERE.default\\prefs.js* and something like *user_pref(\"extensions.mkiosk.password\", \"hunter2\");* ).\n3. Drop the user_ on those lines and apply them per the directions in the guide.","3048":"Oh snap, this is good stuff. I've got it all up now, one click powershell file installs all the things. Just beautiful.","3049":"Nice.  Mind sharing a (sanitized) version of what you ended up with, for others to learn from?","3050":"Not sure why I took so long to get back to this, but better late than never.\n\nPowerShell script **kiosk_firefox.ps1** (runs at deployment time as part of our MDT deployment):\n\n\n    #If Firefox is installed, don't install it again\n    if (test-path \"c:\\program files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox\") {\n    \n    write-host \"Firefox is installed\"\n    \n    }\n    #If Firefox is not installed, install it\n    else {\n    Start-Process -FilePath \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\firefox_46.exe\" -ArgumentList \"\/silent\"\n    sleep 10\n    }\n    \n    #Install Extensions & Settings\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\cck2\\firefox\\*\" \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox\\\" -recurse -force \n    \nSo that essentially runs an offline installer of Firefox 46, and then copies over the folder that has the CCK2 customizations (Firefox settings, extension installs, extension settings). The reason I can't use a regular online installer for it is because CCK2 configurations are version-specific, so it has to be the version that I used to create the CCK2.cfg (in this case, 46) when I copy over the CCK2 files. When it updates overnight as part of our nightly Ninite Pro deployment, the settings seem to be fine. But it has to start out at the same version. \n\nThe real magic is generated by CCK2. The wizard is pretty straight-forward when using it to configure various Firefox settings. I downloaded the .xpi files for BlockSite and mKiosk from Firefox's [Add-On](https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/) page using a different browser, and pointing CCK2 to them. The real trick here is getting the specific settings for the extensions to stick. I basically went through all of the settings on one machine, then found the **prefs.js** file, and carefully copied each line into the CCK2's preferences tab:\n    \n      \"preferences\": {\n        \"extensions.BlockSite.authenticate\": {\n          \"value\": false,\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.BlockSite.enabled\": {\n          \"value\": true,\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.BlockSite.listtype\": {\n          \"value\": \"whitelistRadio\",\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.BlockSite.removeLinks\": {\n          \"value\": false,\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.BlockSite.showWarning\": {\n          \"value\": false,\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.BlockSite.whitelist\": {\n          \"value\": \"www.siteone.org|||*.sitetwo.org|||*.sitethree.com|||catalog.siteone.org|||sitefour.com\/page|||*.sitefive.com|||javascript:*|||siteone.sitesix.info\",\n    \t  \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.BlockSite.whitelistDesc\": {\n          \"value\": \"|||||||||||||||\",\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.mkiosk.admin.lockpwd\": {\n          \"value\": true,\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.mkiosk.admin.passwd\": {\n          \"value\": \"[REDACTED]\",\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.mkiosk.bkp.ori.javascript.enabled\": {\n          \"value\": true,\n          \"userset\": true\n        },\n        \"extensions.mkiosk.config.firstrun\": {\n          \"value\": false,\n          \"userset\": true\n        }\n      }\n    };    \n\nWorks pretty well. In order to update any changes (because of course people discover pages that need added to the whitelist), I just need to update the setting manually one one of the machines, then copy the prefs.js file from that machine to the DFS share and then out to each of the others. The unfortunate part of this process is that it seems Firefox generates the directory for the prefs.js file on a per-machine basis. So I had to manually capture what that directory was for each machine, and then save them in a simple script **kiosk_update.ps1**:\n\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-01\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\n4q5gvxo.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-02\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\oqwzkcok.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-03\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\ex3oi74l.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-04\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\t4xxwsg5.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-05\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\d3dakio9.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-06\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\lr3rtoql.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-07\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\3jrd56sr.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-08\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\52j9mucu.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-09\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\txghozfc.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-10\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\ydmsk6fx.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-11\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\jphnjqiz.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-12\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\w73zdyit.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-13\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\ckoj3s86.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-14\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\8tbpnx49.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-15\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\jyam6bie.default\"\n    copy-item \"\\\\domainDFSshare\\MDT\\Applications\\kiosk\\prefs.js\" \"\\\\kiosk-16\\c$\\Users\\ffkiosk\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\00hqhpyl.default\"\n\n\nFirefox needs to close and re-open to get the changes.

He's ripping barricades apart without slowing down, effortlessly and relentlessly. I pull a mesh over a door and he passes right through it like smoke. My breath starts to catch in my chest and I feel a stitch coming as I focus on staying running when I trip and slide across the floor into a room with a single exit. My pursuer slows as he enters, stands over me and jeers. Then he picks me up one handed and flings me at the wall. I lose all sense of direction. I feel is the force of being thrown, the weightlessness of flight and the pain of impact. All the while I'm hearing him insult me in this really condescending manner as if it was nothing more than a twitter argument. Next I'm held against a wall while knees and uppercuts hit me in both quick and delayed succession. The slander continues. I'm beyond defending myself at this stage, physically or verbally.
