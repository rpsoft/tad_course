Not much can break his skin  anyway, stuff like getting curbstomped by a bunch of frost giants or pimp slapped by Thanos would be much less effective on him. Other than that, not much changes","21":"Goku either loses zenkai boosts because he heals so fast or can now scale infinitely in power if he can still get to a near death state only to almost instantly heal.

The getting there part is a bitch though.","39":"Sometimes its the type of exercise.  I hate being a group and running or competing.  But get in me in a personal challenge sport and I'm all for it.  I've taken up running as a challenge sport, trying to beat my mile times and going for longer and longer distances.  Swimming too, trying to swim for longer periods of time.\n\nBTW, I use to hate running and never understood how anyone could do it for fun.

A good teacher always has his eye on his student's well-being and development. A bad teacher always has his eye on how well he's proved himself to his superiors via the assessments that he's given the students. Good teachers teach because they love watching people learn.

Octopus Vapors will be raising its prices to $15.00 a 30ml bottle. However, we will begin offering free shipping on orders for two or more bottles.\n\nAs a community of vapers that has really helped to get the word out regarding our product I felt that you all deserved an explanation for why we have decided to start charging more. There are two primary reasons. When this company started out I was the only employee and for the last six months it has just been my brother and I filling every order that has come in. We have grown to the point where we need to begin bringing on additional help, which surprisingly enough does not come for free. The second primary reason that we are raising the prices is to help us get out ahead of the looming FDA regulations.\n\nI know that there will be many of you who are frustrated with our company and our brand for raising the prices. Believe me this was not an easy decision to make. I've been mulling over this for about three months.\n\nOur prices have always been more than reasonable, and we believe that even by raising our prices we still fall within the range of reasonable. I personally believe that the quality of juice that you receive along with our customer service is worth what we'll soon be charging. However, what I think and what is reality are often two different things.\n\nThank you all for helping my company grow and for the passionate following the we've received. So much good has come out of this and I hope that it can continue for a long time to come.\n\nAs always if you have any questions you can comment below, shoot me an email, or give me a call.","114":"Honestly, if you buy 2 bottles with free shipping, it is roughly the same amount of money, $29 and some change, as before. I'll continue to use this vendor, they have quality products.","115":"Very true.","116":"Good guy vendor:\n\n*Sells premium gourmet e-liquid at crazy cheap $12 price tag;*\n\n*When raising the price, thoroughly and apologetically explains why*","117":"Thanks, we do try.","118":"I love this guy. I'm still grateful for the test batch of Apple Cider. And the handwritten notes!","119":"For me personally, the 3 extra bucks per bottle is not a big deal. I will still buy plenty of juice from you.","120":"","121":"Frustrated? Not at all. Not only would I be happy to pay $22 per 30mL of your juice by itself I love the letter, presentation, and packaging. \n\nYou've got a premium product and $15 is still more than reasonable.","122":"","123":"Seriously. Don't be apologetic about this. You offer great product, and great service. I'll still be buying. Your previous price was ridiculous.\n\nI'd also like to add myself to the chorus of people who desire bigger bottles. Pillar would be easily worth a 150 or 250ml purchase for me. It is wonderful.","124":"So much this. A friend and I were just saying we wanted a 150 or 250 ml bottle of some of the juice. Sinners cider and that root beer.

Don't think this will hurt you much, and your transparency about the change should serve as a model for others.","128":"Im totally cool with the price raise, i figured it'd only be a matter of time before y'all had to do this, and for the quality of the juice and packaging $15\/30ml is still a great deal imo compared to other companies. ","129":"Exactly this. Part of the cost goes into the presentation and packaging that goes along with a very high quality juice. This might not be for everyone out there, as some I'm sure prefer a simpler design. But for me Whit E. Octopus brings a level of quality and professionalism that I am very confident in buying. ","130":"Thank you so much. This was not an easy decision to make. One of the reasons that I got into making juice to begin with because of the tough financial situation that my family was in. When I founded Whit E. Octopus it was and is really important to me that we offer a high quality product at a reasonable price.","131":"Never ordered from you, but am placing an order now because I dig integrity and stuff. ","132":"These guys are in my top 3 vendors.  Make sure you try Pilar(key lime pie) and Bavarian Cream.\n\nThese are the only juices I try to always keep on stock.","133":"Completely reasonable considering the quality of your juice and packaging!","134":"Thank you.","135":"For the quality you guys offer, this is still well worth it. ","136":"I for one have absolutely no problem with this. $15 a bottle is still an awesome price for such fantastic juice and amazing customer service. You can expect me to continue ordering 1-2 bottles each of Sinner's Cider and Root Beer a month c:","137":"damn i better buy 1000ml of juice tomorrow","138":"Good workers are not cheap. ","139":"No they aren't.","140":"Do you guys do wholesale? If so, can you PM me?","141":"Totally still worth it if you're now offering free shipping on 2+ bottles. \n\nPilar goes fast enough that I can easily justify buying a second bottle","142":"If it makes you feel any better, start charging $15 and stop wrapping\/name tagging all the bottles if that helps you out even further. It is cute and delightful to see when opening, but I am sure those are costs you can cut while still making dank juice and getting it out quickly.

You can try all of our flavors and meet us whenever you'd like. We're typically around from 8:30 in the morn until 6:30 at night, but I'm willing to be here whenever you'd like to come by.","146":"I can certainly work with those hours.  Monday-Friday I'm assuming?","147":"Monday-Saturday. You can always give me a call or shoot me an email. I'll be around tomorrow and through the weekend.","148":"I've never seen so many people supporting raising prices so you must make a really great product. I've never had your juice, but I'm definitely going to be picking some up in the near future.","149":"Dude. I think we are all down for it. I love your juice. Just wish humbug was a all year flavor. XD","150":"Hey, it's a seasonal flavor, as long as we don't fold in the next year, it'll be around again again in 11 months.","151":"But. I got to make my last bottle of six last 11 months now. :( Love you guys. I pray ya'll have a great year! Would love some stickers of your logo to go on my Sigelei. XD I want to show off what I'm vaping.","152":"Honestly i think its better this way. I would rather get a solid idea of my total while shopping rather than having to mentallu add 5 or 6 dollars.

I broke up with my ex boyfriend 4 years ago (we dated 2 years), I cheated on him and told him so. It was a one time fling, but it made me realize that I wasn't happy (albeit a horrible way to do so). It took even longer to realize that how my ex had been treating me was actually not very nice, but we broke up because of the cheating.\n\n\nMy ex has made multiple attempts to reconcile with me as friends, telling me he forgives me, etc. but I have not responded. He has no clue that how he treated me was very wrong and it even makes me question my sanity.\n\n\n\nI then I have to remember that no, it is not normal to force your girlfriend to have anal even when she is crying for you to stop, and you just laugh and \"shhh\" her only to jokingly bring it up later in the relationship as something that was funny. No, it is not normal to make your girlfriend feel guilty for not wanting to indulge in some of your kinks (going as far as saying that if I loved him I would do it), telling me that he preferred anal because my vagina was too loose. Not to mention that he constantly berated me for having a big butt, \"bumpy\" skin and coarse hair. This isn't acceptable is it? Am I too sensitive?\n\n\nSo, this is where I need advice.... do I continue to ignore him? Do I tell him that I don't associate our relationship with good memories? I almost don't want to open that can of worms, because I know he will make it all about himself, but at the same time, I hate that he is going around thinking I won't respond because I am too remorseful about cheating on him. I HATE HIM. I am now with someone who loves every part of me and it is a constant reminder of how much he put me down. What do I do!?\n\n\n\n**tl;dr** Exboyfriend from 4 years ago broke up because of me cheating. He wants to remain friends, but has no clue that he was  abusive(?) and that is why I do not want to talk.

Like many of you have said, it seems to be a ploy and I am 100% certain he will twist it around to make me feel bad. I do not feel like dealing with that because... I don't have to.**\n","241":"I think the answer here is to completely ignore this ex. If you feel the need to contact him at all, one polite email telling him, 'I have put our relationship firmly in the past and would like you to stop attempting to reconcile with me. I will not be responding to further contact.' He wants to engage you in a conversation, he wants to find a way back into having some kind of influence over you. Don't give him the satisfaction. Block his number\/emails\/social media and put all of that energy into enjoying your new, healthy relationship.","242":"Thank you, at the moment this is what I most comfortable with. My partner also thinks this is just a way for my ex to find a way back into having influence over me, as I have ignored over 5+ messages and they still keep coming.","243":"Block everything from him.

I didn't say you should have a long (or even a short) conversation about anything. Literally \"I never want to be friends with you or talk to you again, this is why: http...\"","248":"I see what you mean now, it does sound like a viable option. I suppose I just need to talk myself up to it. ","249":"You could also do a letter. It might be a better format to let you say exactly what you want to him. One problem is that the letter might invite a return letter, although maybe giving him a chance to say last words might actually get him to stop trying to talk to you.","250":"Honestly, who really cares about a rapist's feelings anyway? \n\nEven if he was a good person, if you don't want to keep in touch you don't owe him an explanation. You only give him a response if you want him to. If you feel like you want to explicitly tell him any friendship or communication is off the table, give him your response, block him and move on because any further response will only engage him.","251":"Thanks folks, really helping me put this in perspective.","252":"I wouldn't say anything to him. He will find a way to spin it around back on you and make you feel worse. (Not that I'm condoning how you ended the relationship,  but it's very good that you did) Just tell him firmly that you're not interested in reconciliation and then block him.

This has to be the competitor's website, not the PCPP link.\n\nMemory Express will then beat the price by 25% of the difference. So, if NCIX is having a sale and charging $139.99 but it's regular $189.99 at MemEx, MemEx will give it to you for $127.49 ($139.99 - 25% of $50).\n\nDo this for your whole order and you will find yourself saving a few bucks on each item. If you're buying 7-8 items you can usually save about $50, sometimes less sometimes more.\n\nTheir fee for shipping is then $8.99 flat to anywhere in Canada, so you only pay 1 shipping fee.\n\n**Personal Experience**\n\n[I have purchased over $10,000 worth of items from Memory Express](http:\/\/imgur.com\/WNZ4E3N) and one of the things that pleased me the most is that I've never once been contacted because a price beat couldn't be done - and I put a price beat request on about 90% of my items. A lot of times with other places that price match they will deny it or say \"lowest we can go is X\", but MemEx has always just approved and shipped, assuming the item's price was correct and in stock. MemoryExpress' system automatically screenshots all of the pages when you submit your order, so you don't have to worry about the competitor's price or stock level changing before it's processed.\n\nI've also had to return items for RMA twice, and that process has always been quick and flawless. One was a DOA motherboard for which I received a replacement, the other was a DOA Wi-Fi adapter for which I got a full refund (no restocking fee). Both times they covered the cost of the shipping label and there was 0 hassle. Refund was issued in less than one week from sending out the parcel.","349":"Good to know. I usually go through Newegg because I find that ME shipping takes forever but I will keep this in mind, maybe with the money I save I'll opt for UPS vs. Canada post","350":"The standard ground shipping has always come UPS. Maybe it depends where you live?\n\nTheir shipping is usually 4 business days (AB to Ottawa), but I'd say about 33% of the time it has come a day early.","351":"Hmm, I live in QC. I have only ordered from them once (about a year ago) and the standard shipping was Canada Post (UPS was like $10-15 more). Regardless, I did not know about their price match and as a Canadian PC builder I am always trying to find good deals on parts, so thanks.","352":"Feel free to check out my vaping reviews and let me know how I'm doing! :) thanks all! :) YouTube.com\/mrhostism","353":"Thank you! I may do an ama after a bit of time at the shop. ","354":"not too shabby sir, good luck on your new gig!","355":"Good voice, good audio, quick intro. The lighting in the DNA 40 vid is perfect, try to replicate that in other vids. I wish you much success in your YouTube career! :) \n\nps. you spelled Mutation wrong in the title ;)","356":"I'm know to do that. Haha I never have been good at speeling! ;P ","357":"Hello fellow HS players. My name is Kyle. I have been playing video games since I was a kid with a gameboy and I am 19 now. I have a compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, anxiety, and have issues with moderating what I do. I used to be addicted to heroin. I find that I am getting sucked into Hearthstone too much and I feel like it is taking me away from my real life as much as I am in denial to say so....\n\n This game is mindblowingly fun ain't it? Only one problem though is that I am hopelessly addicted. I find that I never get bored of this game. This is my first real TCG and I am hooked. I play HS around 5-8 hours everyday. I am a student however I usually avoid doing homework until like after midnight because I am so consumed by this game.... I know that a lot of you might say then don't play or suck it up! It is hard for me though :\/ I've uninstalled battle.net client twice and still come back to it..\n\nI have no friends that I am in close contact with at the moment so my social life is pretty horrid. This is my only escape... And I fucking have dreams about hearthstone too no joke right before I'm going to bed... I am not lying. I will like make up plays in my mind against opponents... it's sad really...\n\nDespite playing for so many hours I don't even want to know since I found this game 3-4 months ago, I only have 4-5 legendaries and haven't reached legend rank. I usually grind dailies and go straight to arena. That's my favorite, however sometimes I lose all my gold and have to grind harder. \n\nAnyways... sorry for rambling. My weekend starts today and I just wanted to see if anyone can sympathize with me? I really want to be more productive in my real life and enjoy Hearthstone at the same time... but it ain't easy for me :( \n\nIf I amounted the time I played Hearthstone into something substantial I would be very satisfied.. I have aspirations of becoming a musician and if I spent 1\/5 of the time I do playing HS on it I would get a lot of stuff done...\n\nwould love some feedback. Is it time for a break? I always come back tho :( I am having fun tho right?\n\n**edit:thanks for all the sweet replies. Don't know why some people downvoted a serious question lol. But I appreciate all the answers they were helpful. Will try to follow them tomorrow and see how it goes. My battletag is Synthetic#1634 if anyone wants to chat. Thanks for taking the time to give me advice!**","358":"Hi Kyle.\n\nI know how hard it is, but it's all up to you. You need to set rules for your gaming. Luckily Hearthstone is a game that is easy to play in small amounts as well (I'm referring to the fact that HS has short games, and even full arena runs don't usually take that long.)\n\nYou should think about some increments you could play at a time, and then focus on something else. Maybe one game, two games, three games? An arena run? Whatever you decide on, keep true to it. Play at most that, and then set a timer for 30 minutes or so whilst you focus on something else. When the alarm rings, repeat. :)\n\nI know how addiction works and it can be hard. But if you could quit heroin, I know you can do it!\n\nIf you need someone to talk to, I'm here. Feel free to pm me. I'm a bit of a loner and would like to get to know new people as well. :)","359":"hey ya that's a good idea. Thanks for the support I really appreciate it. I don't know why I am posting this I just feel like I needed to get this off my chest and I'm glad I did. I should probably make a schedule for what I should do and do my best top stop. \n\nThanks man I'll be sure to pm you for help! I am glad you understand addiction, are you addicted to hearthstone? Or have u learned to control urself :p","360":"I wouldn't say I'm addicted to Hearthstone, I can control my gaming quite well and usually call it quits when I get frustrated of faceroll hunters. :)  I do have a couple of friends with substance abuse problems, and have gone too far with drugs myself as well from time to time so my knowledge comes from there.","361":"As hard as it is, you have  to do what makes you happy or more importantly what IS going to make you happy.  If after this weekend of playing 10 hours of Hearthstone you can honestly look yourself in a mirror and say \"I am happy with what I did and I am still continuing my life forward\" then honestly go for it.  But if there is any hesitation that it is either not as rewarding as other things you could be doing , going out with friends \/ finishing up projects \/ getting involved with your school , OR it is impeding your ability to accomplish your long term goals like being a musician \/ graduating from college \/ finding someone special than maybe you should reallocate your time.  If you ever want to talk about depression or anything around that feel free to add me Blinky#1888 ","362":"I can definitely sympathize. I am 40 with many of the same disorders and lack of social life (work 7 days a week). I wish I could offer good advice here but I wish you the best. Knowing that you have a problem is the first step. ","363":"Let's overcome this together!","364":"I'm also a chronic procrastinator. I'll do it tomorrow. ","365":"Hi kyle, you're not alone in this. I haven't been this into a video game in a very long time and I just can't find the reason why. I also have finals in a week and I'm still playing..","366":"Hey man you aren't alone let's conquer this addiction and learn to moderate!","367":"I would say lock up your computer or take an enforced break for some time. Give a friend your power cable or something. Just a week or something. The brain is a wonderful (and complicated) thing and I'm sure it will figure out another way of keeping you entertained - even if this is to make your own hearthstone set out of paper or something!\n\nYou can always come back to it, I'm not saying you should quit cold turkey but give yourself a breather.","368":"Have you thought about just uninstalling it? If your connection is slow enough this avoid impulse redownloads, and \"forces\" your to do something more productive with your time. Try that for a week or two!","369":"Want o know if the build looks fine or if i should change something before i order anything. Open to any suggestions or advices.\n\n[Here's the build.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/2XlDtgn.png)","370":"You don't need the CPU cooler since you're not overclocking, if you're concerned about cooling, you can add some case fans.

In a solo lane or in the jungle?","390":"i think jungle.","391":"Tried him Jungle and Mid. Both went pretty well. \n\nHis isolated Q feels stronger than before. Faced a Wukong Jungle and his isolated Q (evolved Q first) took 1\/3 of his health at level 7. He was full health btw. Might get nerfed in the next patch lol\n\nIn Mid I tried evolving W first. Well, at level 6 I could just E-W into the Wraith camp and everything but the big one was dead immediately. You need about 2 seconds farming the wraith camp with evolved W.\n\nI think he's still a very strong Jungle and lane Kha got much better with the W buffs. Played him Jungle twice and Mid once so that's a small sample size but I like it so far.","392":"his late game got big nerf","393":"Kind of a silly question here, but does his evolved q make taking drag and baron that much easier now? ","394":"Trash can ","395":"Nope.avi. Seriously. Do people even read what's in the patch notes? Kha'Zix' Evolved Q now has THE highest AD-Ratio on isolated targets making 800 - 1000 Damage to one target regardles of their health. The missing health part was overrated. 8% of an 2k ADC was 160 Additional damage max.. People need to live the way that KhaZix does. \"Change.... is good.\" No more R->E->Q Evolution. Rather a Q -> E ->W Evolution. BTT: I think Kha'Zix is still a viable and strong jungler, as well as a sololaner. ( Though he might get a rough time against tanks on top)","396":"The irony. If you dont talk.. you get reported for refusing to communicate with the team. LOL","397":"Talking\/typing isn't required. Just ping.","398":"Indeed. But they report you for not communicating anyways. As far as I know, pings are not recorded anywhere.","399":"Troll reports will be ignored by the system. Also I'm sure system might have some kind of banned word list that it checks against reported players to validate the reports. It's not flawless, but false positives are rare according to Lyte.\n\nIf you think you were unfairly punished, you can always try a support ticket, and they'll do manual checking.","400":"I highly doubt they will do that for me but I'm not even debating that. I might've been slightly toxic in 1\/10 of my games but in 9\/10 of them I'm a very positive player. I'm not even trying to say that I got restricted falsly I'm just very afraid to type anything in chat now because I might get some mad kid that will report me for it... and I will be restricted again.\n\nalso, what system are you talking about because in the old system with tribunal those troll reports were useless indeed because someone would allways revieuw your case but now it's just automated so every report weighs on the scale.","401":"If I tell my jungler this: \"mid has been a free kill for the whole game, why don't you gank?\". He will report me because I'm \"anoying\". Or the famous \"why did you do that\" which I don't consider toxic but some people will still report you for that. stuff like that is stuff I do say sometimes but if that stuff is toxic then this community has just become childish and I will just say nothing anymore.","402":"That's not considered toxic by riot's standards.","403":"well that's the only bad stuff I say and to riot it's not toxic but people will still report you for that and since the system counts reports you will still get restricted like me.","404":"Again, if people report for things like that, most likely the system ignores, otherwise people could just frame a guy and report him for no reason so he gets restricted.","405":"the system doesn't ignore it, it's still a report that will weigh on the total and you can infact frame people.","406":"I was paraphrasing Lyte's description of the report system. I'm sure he knows what he's talking about as he's in the player behavior group at riot.","407":"what he means is that people that spam reports, their reports are worth less but that doesn't change the fact that if someone (who doesn't spam report) reports me for no legit reason I still get a random report on my name. Now imagine a lot of people doing that. Let's face it, people flame you for the most stupid reasons so I can imagine them reporting for the same reasons aswell.","408":"I tried to contact riot support and they've replied with an automated message just like expected. They don't give two fucks to even read my message and I'm so dissapointed and angry right now. They just replied with this: \n\n\"Hello Summoner,\n\nThere has been a high volume of post-game reports against you relative to the number of games you've played. We..\" and so on just an automated message... -_-","409":"How do you know exactly it is an automated message?","410":"That's pretty obvious. For one they allways reply with your name in the beginning. This time however, they started with \"dear summoner\". Secondly it's completely irrelevant to the question I asked them. And you will see it once you read it, it's really obvious. here is the message:\n\nHello Summoner,\n\nThere has been a high volume of post-game reports against you relative to the number of games you've played. We have investigated your account and found higher than average levels of toxicity as a result of your actions in the matches you play. As a result, we have decided to place a series of chat restrictions on your account to help you adjust your behavior in game.\n\nThe Tribunal is currently in extended recess while our development teams work on a number of improvements to the system. In the meantime we will be using chat restrictions to moderate and reform behavior in League of Legends.\n\nPlease keep in mind that failure to adjust your behavior may result in more chat restrictions and possibly in-game bans in the future.\n\nFor more information about chat restrictions, check out our Knowledge Base:\n\nhttps:\/\/riotgames.zendesk.com\/entries\/23395906\n\nAlso, we have begun a new initiative to restrict players from the ranked queue. Ranked Restrictions have a higher threshold for punishment compared to chat restrictions and require more reports and evidence of toxicity. Please bear in mind that not all chat restricted players will receive a ranked restriction.\n\nDuring the time of the ranked restriction, you will need to complete a number of Normal Draft games. After the required number of Normal Draft games has been played, your account will be reviewed again to see if there was an improvement in your behavior. The restriction on the ranked queue will continue if this is not the case.\n\nThis is a good time to re-evaluate in game behavior because if it will not change in the future, harsher punishments will follow. These may include timed suspensions or removal of ranked rewards.\n\nWe have also announced that players who have high amounts of toxicity in their games will not receive their ranked rewards. This system is not currently active, but will be turned on in the following weeks. At this time, we are not able to tell you if you qualify for the removal of rewards. Not every player with ranked restrictions will be punished in this way; only the worst offenders will be affected. If you're concerned about being affected by this feature, I recommend being on your best behavior in the coming weeks.\n\nFor more information about this system, feel free to check out the forum post and FAQ below:\n\nhttp:\/\/boards.na.leagueoflegends.com\/en\/c\/miscellaneous\/1LJP1ovA-ranked-restrictions \nhttps:\/\/support.leagueoflegends.com\/entries\/55968134-Ranked-Restrictions\n\nCharlie Saber \nRiot Games Player Support","411":"Lol, what are you talking about.

A BIOS flash will let you handle the FX Series, so be sure to do that before dropping one in. The 6350 is (in essence) just a 6300 with a better bin, but really not much of a difference.\n\nTechnically you could swing both a 6300 and an R9 280 on that budget. Even an R9 285 or 280X would be feasible and get you bit more of a gaming boost.","434":"I'll probably grab the 6300 tomorrow and the gpu later, then. I hadn't even considered a 285, so I'll look in to it. I'm in Canada so the prices are a bit higher (the sapphire dual-x r9 280 is $179 atm on newegg.com, $259 on newegg.ca lol), but I do plan on upgrading both pieces just not once. Thanks for the advice!","435":"Aha, yeah, Canadian prices would be a touch higher then. The 285 is similar to the 280, just uses the new Tonga core instead of the older Tahiti Pro. Still doesn't quite match the 280X in performance, but is a good mid-range card to be sure.","436":"I know both languages (HTML and CSS) but I wanna know how do they actually create them..","437":"I'd like to split your question up into two different ones.\n\n\nQ: How are HTML and CSS created? \n\nA: HTML and CSS are built within your browser. Most modern web browsers such as Firefox and Chrome use \"rendering engines\" to parse the DOM (Document Object Model). These engines are commonly written in C++ because it is a powerful language, and is OS independent in most cases. Here's a list of the commonly used rendering engines:\n\n* Chrome - Blink (a special type of WebKit)\n\n* Firefox - Gecko \n\n* Safari - WebKit\n\n* Opera - Blink \n\n* IE - Trident\n\nEDIT: Thanks \/u\/adamnemecek for pointing out Opera's rendering engine\n\nAdditionally, there are \"Javascript Interpreters.\" Javascript is an actual programming language unlike  HTML\/CSS since it has variables, control structure, functions, objects, etc. One of the fastest Js engines built is the V8 engine, which is programmed in C++. The V8 project is [open source](https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/v8\/).\n\nThese variations are also what makes some browsers \"faster\" than others. They have different components or \"engines\" which deal with things in different ways. It is completely possible that a browser could play the latest WebGL 3D games at high speeds and still be slow at loading websites. (Although no such thing exists).\n\n\nQ: What are W3C and WHATWG?\n\nA: W3C and WHATWG play a smaller role in this than you might think. All they do is decide what \"modern\" web code should look and function like. What is useful about these organizations is that they provide a unified platform for browser developers to build off of. For example, W3C has decided that HTML should look like so:\n\n    <html>\n\n    <body><\/body>\n\n    <\/html>\n\nBy using this, Google can teach Chrome to understand what all this plaintext means, so that it can successfully render it in the browser. W3C standards are also taken rather loosely in some situations. A while ago, it was once necessary to include this at the start of a document:\n\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n\nBut now, browsers are smarter at recognizing what the document is without the coder having to say. Another example:\n\n    <script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"path\/to\/file\">\n\nNow you no longer have to declare `text\/javascript`, because modern browsers will be able to tell what the file is. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that web \"standards\" are always changing and browsers can choose to adapt to them if they want to be useful. As for programmers, we want our code to be compatible with all the modern browsers so more users can access our websites, therefore we should write W3C compliant code. \n\nHope that cleared it up, let me know if you need any more clarity. Also, I suggest reading [this](http:\/\/www.html5rocks.com\/en\/tutorials\/internals\/howbrowserswork\/) article. \n\n\n","438":"That is one awesome explanation, many thanks, I'll read the article later tonight since I'm on my phone now, wish I had gold to give you :(","439":"No worries, glad to help :)","440":"There are multiple tools used to describe languages. XML is sometimes used to describe language. There are also tools like [BNF](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form), but to my knowledge the standards for HTML and CSS are not backed by a single formal description in their entirety.\n\nIn general, HTML and CSS are created by \"bootstrapping\" on top of already implemented languages. The modern development of the languages probably is not that similar to the original engineering, which had to solve more problems. It's not inconceivable that the original engineering was based on some company-mandated (I believe HTML was produced for work???) flow-chart or markup language.\n\nThese days, design in some parts may consist of: here is a new features, this is how it is spelled, this is how you calculate it, these are the standards for its interchange. So for example: \"New feature: browser odor. Valid tags are [odor,vendor_prefix-odor...]. The value of odor is an IEEE754 float. ...\".\n\nSo it's not like it's \"programmed\" in some language.","441":"Thanks for the link and the detailed info. ","442":"English?\n\nHow the language works is described in a document, like [this one](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/html5\/). \n\nIndividual browsers can implement the standard in whatever language they wish, which would be C++ for most browsers (eg. Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer).","443":"The groups create the language specifications, while the browser development teams implement these standards in their preferred programming language (for instance, say Chromium implements HTML in C++).

Once you get the program you run it, pick your version and run it. \n\nMaybe check piratebay.se and search windows 8. Find one that's highly rated, liked, and read comments.

Add me on Steam. I'll send a PM to my profile.","562":"Hi, I am 16 years old and I just got my first job as a carhop for a fast food place. As I am new to the whole working thing, I have a very limited knowledge base on what I should do with my income. What are income taxes exactly? When will I need to pay them? Should I open a bank account? How much should I save? Please tell me any other information I might need to know that I failed to ask about in the previous questions.","563":"What are income taxes exactly? \n\n- Percent of your income that gets paid to the government. They go to fund the government\n\nWhen will I need to pay them? \n\n- When you started work they had you complete something called a W-4 form. It tells your employer how much they should withhold in taxes to send along. Generally for a part time fast food gig when you are 16 you will get most of that back when you file your taxes. \n\nShould I open a bank account? \n\n- Yes and most likely ask your company to setup direct deposit. (Your manager can help you with that). Without a bank account it will be harder to cash your paycheck. Look for a local bank that doesn't charge feeds just for having the account. \n\nHow much should I save? \n\n- Depends on what you are saving for. The rule of thumb is 10% but since you have all of your expenses covered by your folks I'd say try and save at least 50% for college and the like, more is better.  \n\n","564":"Thanks for the information! I currently have an account with an online bank, would it be hard to cash checks with it?","565":"Get direct deposit if possible.","566":"I don't think it is possible. The bank I use heavily restricts my access to many of its features because I am under 18. Should I just close the account and get one with a new bank?","567":"Direct deposit is through your employer, not your bank. But regardless theres no reason why you should be restricted accesses.. maybe look into an online bank such as Ally. You can deposit checks using their mobile app which is super nice.","568":"Depends on the bank. Most of them have an app you can use to deposit via check. \n\nIf not get direct deposit. You can set it up with your employer","569":"Does your high school offer a personal or business finance class? ","570":"No, but there's a program I'm in where I can take high school and college course at the same time. The college offers finance courses. I might take one over the summer.","571":"I would, and did, do that if I were you. ","572":"I don't know your family so don't assume I'm a jerk for this.  Open a bank account and set up direct deposit.  \n\nNow... protect your information.  When identities are stolen most times it's family members who you trust (I've seen parents do it more times then I can count).  Most people lose their personal information to family members between the ages of 16 and 20.\n\nProtect your bank card, statement, and pin\/password.  \n\nStart saving.  People who are successful are able to save and budget.  Learning how to save early starts good habits.  Even if it's a portion of your check goes into savings.\n\nFinally, when you're 18, start an IRA and begin saving for retirement.  Put money there and forget about it.  When you retire you will be light years ahead of your friends and family who didn't start at a young age.  Your youth is your strength towards retirement saving.  The earlier you start the easier it is and more you save.","573":"Where do you live, I an only speak to the U.S. that being said, I assume you live with your parents, and can claim no dependents. Yes, you should open a bank account, you should save ten to twenty percent of what you make. Don't fall into the the idea that you can afford something because the money is there. At your age you may have a car, you may be saving for one, if you're saving for one put as much money into savings as possible! Also insurance is high for your age group, get good grades there's a discount for that, but be prepared for that. Don't worry about taxes they will take them before you get your check.","574":"I live in Florida. What does it mean to claim dependents?","575":"no dependents means you got no kids","576":"(hopefully)","577":"Hey he is in Florida.  Could be Florida man in training.","578":"How much should you save? Well it depends. I think you should write down\/ think about what you want to do in the future. You are 16 and I'm sure you're not very sure about many things- but regardless, write down a goal- like school, or a car, or just some cushy amount to have in savings. After you have a sense of what you want- make a budget. You probably still live at home so this should be easy. After a month you should get a general idea of how much your monthly pay is- once you have that take out fixed expenses like cell phone bill (if you pay that) or $ for food. Once that's been taken out, pay yourself first - meaning put $ in a bank account and don't touch it unless you have to- this money will fund your goal (school\/car\/emergency fund). After that if you have any left over, spend or save it. Goodluck! Also, if you're going to start saving - look for an account that has interest so the money that's just sitting around will grow a little (won't grow much w\/ interest rates but better than nothing! )","579":"Ok. Should I look at checkings accounts or savings?","580":"If you can open both you should. A checking account normally allows you to withdraw x amount of money\/day vs a savings account which only allows you do withdraw x amount of money x amount of times a month. For example my savings account only allows 6 withdrawals a month, whereas I can withdraw money from checking every day though I wouldn't want to do that because of ATM fees. It's up to you. For me, it's easier to save with 2 accounts because once $ is in savings, I don't touch it. ","581":"I believe the limit of 6 withdrawals per month is some sort of federal limit. Every bank I've had has had the same limit.","582":"Good for you and congratulations on your first job.  Lots of good advice for you in this thread.

Learn to live bellow your means now (meaning, spend less than you make) and you will be so much happier as a grown up. \n\nI remember being in your shoes not so long ago and I always put money in savings as soon as I got paid. That habit has really \"paid\" off.","585":"This has to with future income only. \n\nAlways come early. Earlier than anyone. You will be disciplined, prepared and always look diligent to people. Even if you leave early they will all understand.

Maybe one day I'll be helping kids like me after they get their first jobs.","590":"All of the information here is definitely useful, but you should definitely be asking your immediate family about this type of stuff. They should know about direct deposit, tax situations, opening a savings account, etc. Since it appears you have an account that is managed by a parent, I would definitely go talk to them about open a savings account and organizing direct deposit, as they will be able to help you find the necessary resources and information. Of course, we are all here to help if you have any questions :)","591":"For some reason, asking my parents about finances completely slipped my my mind. Thanks for the advice.","592":"No problem!

He was an awesome best friend.\n\n\nWe then dated and what I assumed would be a fairytale turned into a horror story of repeated breakups and childish behaviour (on both of our parts but a couple of particularly unkind actions on his). In his defence, it was his first relationship ever. He would frequently refuse to apologise, threaten to break up with me over tiny things, or cancel plans.\n\n\nWe eventually broke up just before we were due to move in together. He changed his mind and I was left scrambling for someone to live. I was hurt and furious - but begged for him back - he said no - I went no contact.\n\n\nFast forward six months and I regret losing him altogether. We meet up a couple of times. He tells me he regrets his childish behaviour, I was the love of his life, he regrets his actions and thinks that if he hadn't behaved so immaturely, we might still be together. I apologise too. He mentions us living together in the future with some other friends.\n\n\nI know I love him and I haven't been able to move on. I seem to have loved him for a long time.\n\n\nBut - I want children, he doesn't. He seems firm about this. Our conversation basically ended on the note that although we still have feelings for each other, we know we're not compatible because of the issue over kids. Therefore the most we can be is friends. Last night he messaged me to tell me he missed me and I told him I was worried about both of us getting hurt.\n\n\nAny advice please?\n\ntldr: ex-boyfriend changes his tune and apologises for all of his past actions - but he still wants a different life from the one I do.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary\/question!","604":"Childish behavior aside, children isn't something you can compromise on. One of you will end up resenting the other. Go no contact again, move on. ","605":"Nope nope nope, don't do it.  This is an issue that will break you apart.  He's already proven he's inacapable of an adult relationship, so don't waste time when you have another huge incompatability.","606":"My advice would be to move on. He does not want children and you do. You have different goals in your lives that cannot coexist, and unless one of you is willing to completely change your stance on having children, the other will be dissatisfied(most likely you in this case) with the relationship. \n\nExpress this to him. Don't recognize a quickly changed stance as relevant to your situation. If it seems like he grudgingly gives into it, he may end up regretting it in the future which will lead to problems with your kids. \n\nIf he takes the time to think it over and decides he wants kids, and you feel like he would be the ideal choice for a father, then I would recommend getting into a relationship with him again. ","607":"You guys are just fundamentally not compatible; children aren't a compromise either of you can make without resentment and unhappiness. \n\nThere's also the fact that you don't have proof that's he's finally capable of being an adult in an adult relationship, OP. \n\nGo no contact again. You aren't going to be able to get over him if you're still in contact. \n","608":"Title says it all.","609":"[This](http:\/\/imgur.com\/sMV9tRd).    \nIt's on \/r\/unexpected.

Majority of people that I met that have said similar things as the OP all ended up being deists. They believed in god, didn't follow any religion and ultimately believed god created the universe and that's it. Nothing more than that.  So that is why I said that.  Now you can say I shouldn't assume just based on not following any religion doesn't make one automatically a deist and you would be correct, however my personal experience with people like that (not following religion) led me to that conclusion.\n\nDid that answer it? If not , then I don't know what else to tell you.","621":"First ask yourself \"which god\". There are so many, so figure out which one seems the most likely. Then analyze how close this particular god aligns with your own personal feelings. My guess is it will be almost exactly. You have now discovered the \"real\" god. The delusional, imaginary being that exists simply within your own mind.","622":"Best advice i can give is go easy on yourself, if you look at the myriad of false beliefs that are in circulation in all of human history its pretty staggering. Its really hard for the individual any individual to just shrug all this off. \n\nI deal with people on a regular basis that believe things that someone simply made up because they found it emotionally soothing. When the truth is that science and psychology have a much better case to make.\n\nFinding out about yourself should be a amazing journey , don't let the mistakes of the past cast a shadow on you, good luck and being true to yourself takes bravery :) ","623":"This makes you a person.

I've been diagnosed bipolar 2 along with BPD, and I had an abusive relationship in the past which still weighs on me heavily sometimes. \n\nSo my boyfriend is pretty much the best SO you can have. He's intelligent, funny, and we share a lot of the same interests. We've been friends since we were children so we know each other very well, and he never treats me with anything but love and respect. We've been dating for almost 2 years now. I know that we are young but we share a very deep bond, especially because he's been so understanding with all of my mental problems. \n\nThe problem comes from my side. People with BPD are known to have separation anxiety when it comes to their SOs. I've realized that when we haven't spent physical time together I get very moody. I feel like I always want to be physically close to him. And I know that it's impossible to be next to him all the time, but I still want it. We just came back from a week-long vacation with his family (they've become my second family and I love them), and I'm taking not being with him every second really hard. I miss falling asleep next to him and I just feel so lonely. I'm tearing up writing this and I don't even know why. \n\nSo I need your help, Reddit. I don't want to be the clingy girlfriend, but I really don't know how to cope with not being physically close to him. The last thing I want to do is trap him, especially because he's a very free, happy-go-lucky guy. What do I do?\n\nAlso yes, I have communicated a lot of this to him. He's very good and stays relatively close to me in public settings because I can get overwhelmed and when I'm sad he just hugs me. He knows that's what I need to feel loved. But I don't think he knows the full extent of this. \n\nTL;DR: I've basically got the best damn boyfriend ever but I don't know how to cope with being away from him. \n","683":"I know it's very easy to \"cling\" and want to be around someone 24\/7, but try to remember that time alone is also good for you, and it makes the time you spend with him more special. \n\nI know what you mean, and I know the exact feeling you're describing, because I've experienced it--I think it's pretty common, and admitting to it means you know it's an issue for you, so you should work on it. For me, I'll distract myself when the guy isn't around, and I'll tell myself I can only check my phone once every half hour or so. \n\nI'll give myself tasks, like organizing my room, cleaning the bathroom, getting homework done, etc. Things that need to get done anyway, and require my full attention. It keeps me distracted, and makes me more productive! Anything that keeps you from being on your phone (checking it, or blowing his up) is a good thing!\n\nTry getting lost in a good book, starting a new series on Netflix, or hanging out with some other friends. A shopping trip by yourself can be a good way to unwind, too. If possible, pick up extra hours at work--this means more money for you, and less time to blow his phone up or overthink anything.\n\nI'm glad you have an understanding boyfriend, but remember, smothering anyone will eventually take its toll. Healthy relationships require some amount of distance--even married couples need their own time sometimes. Give yourselves time to miss each other. I hope I could help in some way. :) Best of luck!","684":"To be honest, dealing with your mental health is very much more important right now than whether you have a boyfriend.  I mean VERY much more important.  You have BPD and a history of abusive relationships.  Are you in counseling?  Are you at least taking your prescribed medication?\n\n","685":"Yes, I am in weekly therapy and take a cocktail of meds daily. I was diagnosed a little over a year ago, so we were dating for about 8 months when I was undiagnosed and unmedicated. Our relationship has improved A LOT since then, although I tried to hide everything from him for a while. But he's accompanied me to therapy a few times and we've gotten very good at communicating what we need in order to stay happy in the relationship. I let him know that if he feels overwhelmed at any time I would understand if he wanted to break up. \n\nAs for the abusive ex... I don't know. I do think part of this anxiety stems from my love being rejected and my therapist agrees. I was only 13 when we started dating, and I didn't really know anything else. But it is something I'm working on in therapy. ","686":"As a former \"happy-go-lucky guy\" to someone with BPD, I'm just gunna honestly say talk to a\/you're doctor. It's what that are their for and their gunna know YOU and what's going on in you're life better than reddit! I can tell that you really don't want to be the \"stage 5 clinger!\" And I can tell you really care for him, so please do what my ex didn't and talk to you're doctor! This is a common thing and with  everything you've been through the doctor will easily understand and will help you find a HEALTHY way of dealing with it.

It was only with beginner bots, in actual normal battles and ARAM, she was too hard for me at this time. How is Lucian compared to her? I was thinking of refunding her IP and buying Lucian.\n\n*edit* Thanks guys, I'll just save up more IP and get Lucian later and save my refunds if I want RP back.","701":"Don't refund IP. Try her out a bit, see how you like her, then get Lucian when you have enough IP again.\nThey're both very good.","702":"Just keep playing and getting IP that way.  In the long run you'll come to see that IP comes and goes, and it is a waste of a refund to use on this, especially since later on you'll probably want to buy her again anyway. ","703":"Agree with everyone else. You only get a limited amount of refunds, so its best used for big RP purchases you regret later.\n\nI would say Lucian is *easier to learn than Vayne. Lucian has a pretty straightforward kit, and his early level burst is pretty high, so he's a strong champ to keep in your arsenal (although he falls off late game).\n\n*Edit: forgot a word","704":"I wouldn't say that Lucian is easier to learn, just that he's much stronger than most other ADC's early on in the game, making him more forgiving to play. Also Lucian doesn't fall off late-game, just that he doesn't become a hyper-carry either.\n\nVayne's kit is actually more straight-forward, since she has no real skill-shots and one of her abilities is purely a passive, plus her actual passive doesn't require much thinking around. The truly hard aspect of Vayne is mastering her weak early game.","705":"Yeh lucian has a skillshot, that are both incredibly hard to dodge without using a dash if your opponent has a couple functioning brain cells. ","706":"Well you played them both. It's fine to just pick the one you like more.\n\nVayne takes more skill to use effectively, and has a higher skill cap. Not to mention that Vayne is hard countered in lane by most popular ADCs.\n\nSo honestly if you really wanna refund it, I support your idea. You get 3 refunds and, really just be more thoughtful next time. ","707":"I just bought Lucian tonight and played 2 games with him. My first game ended as 11\/11. My teammates lost hard in lane and fed, I had 11 out of my team's 12 whole kills. The second game was a lot better. At the beginning the other team was down 2-3 players due to lag but eventually it evened out and both teams were 5v5. I went about 20\/10 with some assists. I could pretty much delete anyone on the other team except for a smart, fed Viktor. \n\nIn my opinion he was pretty easy to pick up and I think he is strong throughout the entire game, especially early game. Just what I have observed in my 2 games with Lucian. ","708":"She's not bad enough to waste a refund on. She is still very strong after a couple items, but her laning phase imo feels very underwhelming, but you're probably not in diamond tier so other adcs probably won't be harassing you as much. ","709":"Lucian is easier to learn than Vayne, mechanically he seems more complex, but in practice its a lot easier to get the hang of him compared to Vayne.\n\nVayne is also a bit underwhelming at the moment in the meta, but this will change. Traditionally she's kind of been always viable on the basis of her huge lategame scaling, but the current early game focus for botlane really strains that.","710":"title","711":"comment","712":"chicken","713":"whiny adc mains cause melee's actually get onto them for once l0l","714":"i'm a junglern, it's a fungamemode and it gets killed by full tank comps imo","715":"i'm a jungler","716":"I don't see how full tank mode ruins the game.

For example, FORTRAN was designed to be optimal for scientific computation (FORmula TRANslation). COBOL, on the other hand, was built for business operations (COmmon Business Oriented Language). Other languages are good at other things- instruction (BASIC, Haskell), speed and optimization of code (C, C++), and so forth.\n* Platform. Different computer systems came with their own operating systems, and they had not only different hardware architecture, but in some cases radically different ways of managing memory, input and output and display. They were frequently designed for specific applications and the languages used on these platforms expressed that application.\n* Use. Different languages work better in a different context. For example, if you're writing web applications you'll be better off using a language suited for that environment. You'll have a very hard time writing a web app in C++, for example.\n* Design. As computer science matures, we discover new ways of doing things. Back in the days when languages like FORTRAN, COBOL and C were dominant, we didn't have any concept of object-oriented programming. Turbo Pascal 4 brought that to the masses, and OOP took off. Now we have different ways of looking at data and structures, which in order to work require languages capable of expressing those concepts. It's frequently better to build a new system that uses these concepts from the ground up than to try and make something built as a totally different language work with a new paradigm.\n\n","790":"Different languages are better geared for handling different types of problems.  For instance, if you're doing something with a lot of list manipulation, Lisp is going to be easier to use than C.\n\nDifferent languages often use entirely different types of approaches for writing code.  For instance, a functional language like Haskel is going to be very different from a procedural language like C, which is very different again from an object-oriented language like Java.  These different types of languages force you to use very different approaches to how you solve problems with them, and some people may fine one type of approach easier to understand than another.\n\nAlso, individual computer scientists often end up being dissatisfied with some aspect of an existing language, and will create a new language that addresses what they perceive as its shortfalls.  Sometimes, the new language becomes popular enough to gain traction, and becomes a new \"major\" language.","791":"There is no UN agency that hands out permission to create new computer languages.  People do what they want; and what some people want to do is create new computer languages.","792":"Because anyone can make a language, and different languages can provide benefits over other languages, if those languages get support from hardware, or software the languages become popular. Imagine trying to use a modern database without SQL or writing a dynamic website without JS (pre-HTML5 of course).","793":"Apartment I shared with three other dudes in college, years ago.\n\nMy friend brought home a girl from the bar. She stayed in his room. She was drunk. She got up in the middle of the night to pee. When she came out, she went into my room instead of his, curled up in bed with me, and went to sleep.\n\nI don't know how much time passed but I was dreaming that a girl was in my bed. I kind of woke up and felt her next to me. It took a moment to register but, when it did, I jumped up. This woke her up. She fell out of bed, tried to get up by supporting herself on my desk chair (which had wheels) and fell down again. She got up and stumbled out of my room. I went back to sleep.\n\nShe was gone when I finally got up. Saw her once after that. She didn't talk to me.","794":"Another one that I think is funny is this time my dad and I were watching an Indian soap opera (really over dramatic, like a tele-novela) and there was an old women with crazy hair and make up, and he says to me that she looks like that women from the movie \"*Domination One-O-One*\" \n\nIt was only later that I realized he was refering to Cruella DeVil from 101 Dalmatians.","795":"I was studying abroad in Russia, and a conversation about school came up with my host mom...\n\nMe: \"Oh yes, I have a wonderful \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433 (friend who is male) at school\"\n\nHost mom (with great interest): \"Can you show me his picture?\"\n\nMe: \"Sure, perhaps later?\"\n\nHost mom (curiosity is apparent): \"Well, if it's not too much trouble, show me now!\"\n\nI take out my camera (wondering at the sudden urgency of my task) and stop at a picture of my two best guy friends at school and myself. She asks me to point out my friend, but I mention that they are both my friends, or \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f. Suddenly it dawns upon the both of us that we had been talking about entirely different situations. \n\nApparently, in colloquial Russian, \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433 can mean boyfriend. Once I mentioned I had \"two,\" she realized the miscommunication. It was definitely a learning experience; I am very careful to use the proper word for \"friend who is male\" as opposed to just \"male friend\/boyfriend.\"","796":"Haha!!\n\nWow, that must have been awkward for a second.

It can get confusing.","797":"I have just got a dual monitor setup and when I move my mouse too fast in game, my cursor moves to the other one for a second and I play competitive games (mailnly CS:GO), so when i flickshoot or something like that. it goes to my other screen and that's very irritating.

Is that not an option?\n\nI can't confirm this, but from a couple of google searches it seems the 600 series is slower than a 580 in terms of rendering with CUDA cores.

How does that make me an AMD fanboy? I believe in informing of all the options. He said in another post that gaming isn't the priority, so I was addressing that. Doesn't it make sense for him to at least know about his other options? He posted elsewhere that he never really got help before also. I'm not misleading him, I'm not yelling at him like some members of these subreddits would, I'm not twisting his arm. I'm simply talking about what might suite him better, whether it be Nvidia or AMD. I don't see what to get so pissed off about.\n\nAlso, I've heard quite the opposite with the 680.

I started smoking just over a year ago, just before Christmas. My past history includes depression, and obesity. I had always been kind of a slacker, but once I started smoking it opened my eyes to a whole new world. My depression finally lifted, and I started to see the world a new. Around August I had finally taken enough of myself and wanted to change how I looked. I went to the gym every day, started eating healthy, and even my marks in school shot up.\n \nI used to weight 285 pounds, and never could I of imagined losing even 20 pounds. 6 months later I've lost 85 pounds, gained a huge amount of self confidence, and I still manage to smoke a bowl here and there with my ent buddies on my new night schedule.

However the written attack speed when you select the plants is always the same, so this is surely a bug and likely has something to do with the alterations made to AI.

In your case, it sounds like you would want a motherboard with a good amount of SATA ports so you can run many drives in RAID. The UP4 is a highly recommended motherboard on the enthusiast level X79 platform. It includes a ton of SATA ports so you can run your PC as a home server.\n2. The best video card available is debatable. Both Nvidia and AMD have flagship cards that are very strong performers. Nvidia's flagship cards are the 690 and Titan. The 690 is two 680 GPUs on one board. The Titan is the fastest single GPU card on the market. They're priced similarly, and the 690 outperforms the Titan, but the 690 can only run in 2-way SLI while the Titan can run in 4-way SLI. Nvidia just recently released its new 700 series cards, the 770 and 780. The 780 uses the same GPU as the Titan, but is cut down just a little bit. Benchmarks show it performing VERY similarly to the Titan in many games. \nOn AMD's side, their flagship cards are the 7970 GHz and the 7990. The 7970 Ghz is a very strong card, beating out Nvidia's previous top card, the 680, especially at higher resolutions. The 7990 is two 7970 GHz edition GPUs on one PCB, similar to the 690. iirc, the 7990 is the fastest card out right now. However, there's been some issues with AMD's multi card solution right now in the form of bad \"frame ratings.\" You can google that and it'll bring up a bunch of recent articles explaining it. I really recommend the GTX 780 right now in any high end rig.\n3.  GDDR5 RAM is really only on video cards. I wouldn't worry about that. I added 32 GB of DDR3 RAM to the example build because you said you were doing software development. More\/faster RAM can help speed up things like compiling. Generally, for gaming builds, 8GB is what's recommended. Some take 16GB for things like video editing.\n4.  PCIe SSD's are fast, but I wouldn't recommend them because of their price. If you want fast read\/write speeds for temporary storage, you should look into RAMdisks, in which case you might want more RAM.\n5.  The 3930k is pretty much the top of the line, consumer CPU. There's faster, but they're not really practical in most uses as they're upwards of $1000.\n6.  Multiple monitors. You should definitely look into 1440p as well.\n7.  Scythe Gentle Typhoons perform very well on radiators.\n\n\nSorry for the formatting, especially in #2. Line breaks break the numbered list formatting. I definitely would not recommend building this in mineral oil. There's really no cooling benefit to it. ","999":"Wow!!!! THAT IS DETAILED! Thank you very much!. I'll look into ALL of that. I was only expecting some names of brands and possibly a product people liked! Wouldn't the mineral oil with pump and radiator keep the CPU cooler than the CPU Cooler though? Since the case is an aquarium, I can't really have internal hard disks, and I should've mentioned it. Most likely I would have one of those hard disk type towers that sit next to the case.  \n\n1. As I don't know much at all about motherboards, the UP4 I'll have to research. I think I saw it has 4 PCIe slots and they allow for double-width cards. That 'sounds' sufficient.\n2. WOW! You really know your graphics cards. I am going to have to re-read that a couple times with Google open when I have some free time to better understand everything. That is a lot to take in and very resourceful!\n3. Ah. That explains why PS4 I guess will be having it. Yes, my career is in programming so I don't know exactly HOW MUCH ram I will need eventually, but since the motherboard supports up to 64gb, 32 should be more than enough for right now. Is there any real difference in companies for ram, or just stick with what you linked?\n4. But EXCEPT for price.... how fast are we talking ;) I thought 100gb or less would be enough just to keep OS on for boot purposes, then of course still have the other hard disks for a RAID. I have never seen the configuration so I don't know how it all works.\n5. i7 3930k. Sounds good to me\n6. 1440p? Why is that? And of course I'm going multiple monitors though.\n7. Hmmm, that's another one to look at then. I believe the other Redditor had suggested Corsair.\n\nDid you click the title? I should've added the link in the description. It's a mineral oil aquarium PC case with pump and radiator. I saw you added a PC case to the list of items, but the tool might just require a case?","1000":"You submitted this post as a text post, meaning clicking the title leads to this page. You may want to edit the link into the post.\n\nMineral oil doesn't dissipate heat very well. You'll have a decent starting temperature, but it'll slowly climb. In a high end rig like this, you should definitely look into a custom watercooling loop. Its a big task, and will cost a pretty penny, but if you really want to overclock and push your components, there's not really any practical ways to get better temps. If you don't plan on overclocking too far, a closed loop water cooler like the Swiftech H220 is the best option. They're almost maintenance free and fairly easy to install.\n\n1.  The UP4 is a solid board. Definitely do some research though to see if it would fill your needs or if you'd be better off going with another option.\n2.  Some sites to look out for during your googling are Anandtech, HiTechLegion, Tom's Hardware, Hexus.net, and Legit Reviews.\n3. I'd actually recommend going with a 4x8GB kit of DDR3-1866 RAM. This would give you a the same 32GB of RAM now, with the option to upgrade to that 64GB of RAM later on. The company isn't really an issue, but there's difference in models that could make one kit slow down. Its generally recommended to grab two of the same kits so that there's no compatibility issues.\n4. Honestly, I can't recommend them. We're talking about $600 for a 240GB drive. If you were building some crazy server, they'd be a great option, but they're not really meant for desktops. PCIe SSDs generally bench at a around 2x the speeds of a normal SSD, but I have no experience with them so I can't really say whether or not you'd see any real-world benefit out of using one. RAMdisk is more practical, but its not permanent storage. They're generally used as scratch disks for temporary files. If you want quick access to a file while working on another project, you'll be able to access it instantly. The downsides to RAMdisks are that you're limited to whatever partition of RAM you're using as a disk, you're giving up program use of that partition, and you lose whatever is on the RAMdisk when you power off, so you need to move the files from there to a permanent location before shutting down.\n5. \n6.  1440p is just a higher resolution. [Here's an image](http:\/\/hometheaterreview.com\/images\/1440p_video_resolution.gif) giving you a little explanation to how much more screen you get. 2560x1440 monitors usually come in 27 or 30\" models and will run you around $400 each. Some people use a 1440p monitor as their primary desktop and have 1080p monitors surrounding it.\n7.  Corsair's not a bad choice. They're definitely among the most attractive fans and priced well, but they're a little lacking. They're a little loud and don't perform as well as other fans. Gentle Typhoons are consistently near the top of the charts when it comes to radiator purposed, static pressure fans. Some other suggestions are Gelid Wings, Noctua NF-F12's, and Silverstone AP 123's.\n\nOh, and the case was just a stand-in. I would not recommend that case, but choosing a case is mostly preference.","1001":"Ah. Dumb link. I thought I pasted it in there. Yes, the mineral oil PC has a pump, holes ported already for the pump, and it goes to a 3x3 fan radiator behind it. It's supposed to be cooler than CPU liquid cooling allowing for safer overclocking. Also the kit is nice in that it already comes with a hood for PC components, and a slide out motherboard mount in the back. RAMdisk sounds like more hassle than any real benefit. What about just a SSD then for booting, and standard HDs for storage? How long of boot time would I be expecting on Windows8 with that? Also, with how sneaky Windows is, which operating system gives me the controls I need without their bloat free programs that I can get later, if you know?http:\/\/www.pugetsystems.com\/aquarium-computer.php","1002":"Don't worry, it happens.\n\nI still can't recommend mineral oil, even with the numbers that they show in their videos. Going with that will void your warranty on many parts and should you need to perform maintenance, it will be very messy.\n\nI'm currently using Win7 on a Crucial M4. Its a fast SSD, but not as fast as the 840 Pro. I boot into windows within 10 seconds. Windows 8 included optimizations for SSD users, so its very likely that you'd see even faster boots. When you install Windows yourself, you won't get all that bloatware. I'm pretty sure the only things on your desktop will be My Computer and Recycle Bin.","1003":"I have read all of the risks with warranties and the stickers all fall off and more. My pals all have a ton of leftover cases and they offered to let me use one to test out the parts before I go all the way with pouring in mineral oil. I just won't make sure to pay for any extra warranties beyond being able to replace it if it's faulty. \n\nUnder 10s sounds like a godsend. That's definitely fast enough that I don't need PCIe SSD.\n\nAs for performing maintenance, can you give me an example? Once it's together, the only thing I could see needing maintained would be if the motor in the pump went out. Like I said, I believe the motherboard bracket slides out the back so I don't need to put my hand into the mess or pour it out to add more RAM later. The hood also if I saw correctly has room for USB ports or what not, and I plan on having my hard disks in a tower next to the aquarium so that if need be, I can evacuate with my hard disks and not the tower.","1004":"I still can't recommend it. But if you're set on it, more power to you. It sounds like you've actually done a fair bit of research and know the risks. The issue with how you'd like to configure your hard disks is that You probably won't be able to find SATA cables long enough to run from the PCI SATA passthrough they include. You may want to consider using a single HDD in the top bay as they have it, then building or buying a NAS (Network attached storage) for you mass media and to use as your home server. \n\nAs far as maintenence goes, I don't really know what maintenence will come with it, but any will be messy. The big thing I don't want to see is you doing this, deciding that you no longer want the submerged rig and want to move to a traditional computer, and not being able to use the computer for a long time because you'll have to drip-dry your components.\n\nYeah. I don't think I could live without an SSD in my computer anymore.","1005":"Well, it is a shame I won't be able to attend lan parties, but as it is going to be a main piece in my living room. I'm hoping it will be aesthetically pleasing to friends and family visiting, as well as I'm hoping I can save money by my overclock potential vs upgrade in hardware. The probably with a hard disk in mineral oil is supposedly there's air holes in HDs in case of different climate pressures or something, and the mineral oil can get in there and interrupt the spinning of the platters. Or so I read.","1006":"You can always move you desktop, it's just going to be really heavy. And you can just build a mITX build.","1007":"Mine is BF4, even though I only paid $25.","1008":"I can proudly say I am happy with every single purchase I made.","1009":"Uuhhm..

Examples of this would be Lux, Brand, Vel'koz, Xerath, etc... The reason for this is that you have an instant blink with no cast time, meaning you can dodge their important skillshots quickly (Lux snare, Brand pillar or Q\/ Vel'koz knock up, Xerath stun) and go in on them when they don't have their CC ability. Your main job is to be an assassin so it's better if you're against someone who's really squishy, instead of someone like Swain mid for example.\n\nI don't play Talon that much, but some simple tips are:\n\n* Your Q is an auto reset. Utilize that fact for the maximum damage. As a result, your combo should be something like: E > Auto > Q > W > R while throwing an ignite in there somewhere.\n* Your ultimate gives movement speed. Just keep this in mind.\n* If you get a Hydra, there is a trick you can do with gromp. By standing next to the wall where the Gromp is, you can use the Hydra active to make it aggro onto you and auto you over the wall. This gives you vision of the gromp and you can jump over with your E onto the gromp and escape (or chase). This works for all champs, but it's important for champions like Talon whose jump\/blink is a click and point ability. ","1061":"About your third tip. This also works on blue buff if you use your w on it, the little sentries will attack you and give you vision.","1062":"You can do it with blue buff and raptors as well with Hydra (certainly on Wukong), and I would imagine W works for all of them too.","1063":"It doesn't really have a use on raptors since the raptors have a pretty small AA range so they have to walk to get to you and by then you won't cover a lot of distance with your E. And yes you can do it with any ranged ability. ","1064":"I've been watching Scruum (Master\/challenger Talon main) and he got this command in his chat of matchups (easy\/hard) and this is what it says:\n\nEasy matchups: Jayce, Vel'koz, Annie, Orianna, Brand, Karthus, Lux, Zyra, Veigar, and Syndra are all easy matchups for Talon\n\nFrom what i've seen, he's streaming pretty often. (http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/killercruiser) He doesnt really have a lot of viewers (60-100) so its not hard to get your questions answered! Pretty nice. Oh found the stream schedule:\nEveryday: anywhere from 8 AM-11 PM (UTC-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada)\n\nAnd here is his guide: http:\/\/www.lolking.net\/guides\/320430\n\nZydico explained why the squishy mages are easy matchups and some good tips :)\n\nHard Matchups: Vlad, Cho'gath, Leblanc, Katarina, Diana, Kayle, Lulu, Rumble and Urgot are all hard matchups for Talon","1065":"Hi, Talon main here ready to help you !\n\nImmobile mages are arguably his most favorable match ups. Such as Lux, Twisted Fate, Syndra , Brand etc. \n\nHis worst match ups are vs champions who can constantly poke him down in lane which you can't all in easily either because they can kill you much easier than you can kill them. Such champions would be Kennen, Pantheon, Swain, Mordekaiser or champions with a lot of utility\/cc in their kits such as Lulu, Kayle, Lissandra. \n\nThough as with every other assassin, it's all about finding windows of opportunity and knowing powerspikes and cooldowns well to decimate the enemy laner or creating an advantage through roaming.\n\nThere are a lot of tips I could give you but nothing would be as good as VaporaDark's [guide](http:\/\/www.mobafire.com\/league-of-legends\/build\/vaporas-guide-to-talon-336414), which I highly recommend reading if you want to know everything about Talon. \n\nLastly I recommend checking out \/r\/talonmains \n\n^^^^^^^Best ^^^^^^^skin ^^^^^^^is ^^^^^^^the ^^^^^^^Crimson ^^^^^^^Elite ^^^^^^^one.","1066":"Is Azir an easy or hard match up ? \n\nI played yersteday against a Talon on my smurf and I died one time during the laning phase and lost my tower first but I was still relevant in teamfight because I was just farming as much as I can. I rushed Zhonya and took exhaust as second summoner spell. In teamfight I was just using my wall and exhaust for stopping Talon to kill my ADC because he wasn't able to kill me with the Zhonya.\nHere is the match history : http:\/\/matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com\/fr\/#match-details\/EUW1\/2114191634\/219869001","1067":"I haven't played this match up a lot but Talon has to be really cautious in early levels to avoid getting harassed (just like he should do in laning phase as with most other match ups) . \n\nPre-6 you have a chance to kill him at level 4-5 if he uses his w-q first to harass you because early game his q cooldown is around 8~ seconds and he needs it if he wants to escape you or get a shield to stand a chance fighting you to reposition his soldiers for his e. So yeah you can jump him around that time. \n\nAt lvl 6 this match up gets a bit tricky. Your e places you directly behind him and he can then just use his ult to throw you in his tower. So most likely you will need flash if you want to all in him at full hp. If you don't want to all in him with your full combo when he is full hp then you can poke him down to like 75% of his hp and then destroy him with all of your kit even if he throws you directly under his tower.\n\nExhaust doesn't do much early and mid game to him as he can gladly trade his whole combo for an exhaust and all in you later, since azir without ignite has no way to kill a Talon (at least alone) unless talon does a huge mistake. \n\nWhen you get Tiamat just shove the wave in and roam and try to be fast while doing so because azir is probably one of the faster tower destroyers (from the mage champions of course).\n\nThe main thing to remember here is to abuse the time where he uses his w-q combo offensively or to farm. I may have forgotten something but if you have any furthermore questions do not hesitate to ask me.","1068":"Thanks for answering :) ","1069":"worst matchup is diana try to avoid that lane,best are pretty much every mage with no escapes and squishy champs","1070":"Quick tip: if you have an unfavorable matchup (most people have the good matchups posted already), what you should look to do is rush tiamaat's and shove the wave into turretand roam. W->tiamaats will crush the wave. This is really what you should be doing in any matchup. I like to get tiamaats and mobys","1071":"My next crafted legendary.

Is it worth it? Please tell me that it's worth it!\n\n* **Thalnos:** I hear a lot of good things about this baby, but it's basically a Kobold + Loot Hoarder in one card... It's like a permanent card advantage IF your deck runs Kobold + Loot Hoarder since replaces 2 slots for 1\n\n* **Nozdormu:** So much fun, I'd like to have one but I fear that it's not competitive at all...\n\n* **Edwin VanCleef:** I heard it was nerfed, is it worth it? Looks like a buff Questing Adventurer\n\n* **Hogger:** So badass, so thug, but 4\/4 for 6 is kinda lame and 2\/2 taunts are vulnerable to every single area spell\n\n* **Leeroy Jenkins:** Looks cool, I like the idea of a decent charge but it's basically a Fireball\n\n* **Illidan Stormrage:** His ability is nice but at so low health I fear that he is going to get killed very fast, if not immediately\n\n* **Malygos:** Very nice, decent attack and good health but unfortunately too heavy, sitting at 9 mana\n\n* **Cairne Bloodhoof:** Nice stats but at 6 mana, and vulnerability to silence\/poly\/hex seems too risky.

In the late 19th century, politicians and social scientists gave Toronto nicknames such as \"City of Churches\" \"The Queen's City\" and \"Toronto the Good.\" People couldn't drink on Sunday, and you bought liquor from the LCBO in brown bags so as not to 'offend' people. This culture produced Ontarians that were (stereotypically) quiet, demure, polite, etc. Of course by no means was all of the province like that, but probably the urban elite of Toronto with whom most Americans would have interacted could have been at the root of this idea. Imagine that British stiff upper lip idea with a conservative Protestantism, minus the powerful British Empire identity...

Any tips?\n\nTL;DR how do you beat reno?","1248":"By beating them before Reno, or doing 59 damage to them.

If you have a sneaky 15-20 dmg in hand they are not inclined to play reno that quickly, right?","1253":"As mill rogue, all Reno does is let them survive to 12 fatigue damage per turn instead of 7.","1254":"Just try not to play a deck that has a finite amount of damage (like oil rogue, freeze mage, etc) or try to play something that will just kill them before Reno.\n\nOr...\n\nPlay rogue with double beneath the grounds :)\n\nNinjaEdit : Forgot to mention you can also play a deck that has a combo win condition (like any Malygos deck). They can't Reno if you kill them in one turn.","1255":"or inner fire priest!","1256":"Loving this time right now (RenoLock here) only because it's killing the aggro game and secret pally isn't a problem. I'm only super happy after my opp has said sorry each turn and well played repeated when I'm at 3 health only to lifetap, get a sorry from the opp again, and then reno to him threatening.\n\nThat all being said TIPS FOR BEATING RENO AND AS A ROGUE!: Yes this deck is frustrating but I've been trying to figure out counters. Rogue is the way to go for a good reason: Beneath the Grounds. If you run 2, you can get one off and shuffle three copies into their deck thus killing reno for a bit. Pop the 2nd, then its 6 copies and you get a 4\/4 while he draws. As the player you need to realize when it is a Reno deck and not \"burst\" all your cards at once. Reno wins against aggro because players are using their entire hands then top decking once their opp has regained control, health, and is now dropping 7+ mana drops.","1257":"Problem is that you dont want to have BtG in your deck against aggro decks (it's pretty good against CW or priest tho). So you have to consider if teching one will improve or decrease your winrate on the long run.","1258":"Oil Rogue has a really tough time dealing with Reno since the amount of damage in the deck is fairly limited. If Reno is what you're seeing the most, I'd recommend switching to a deck with a more minion-based strategy.","1259":"Hmm seems like a good point, only issue is I dont really enjoy playing other decks. But I guess if I wanna climb im gunna have too. Thanks.","1260":"What's your oil rogue deck? If you play a more minion based oil deck with only one oil + boom + van cleef you may have a decent chance. But overall the only Reno deck you have a decent shot at is maybe renolock since oil rogue doesn't have a good way to apply sustained pressure. ","1261":"Yea i'm running Mr Yaguts list with the Boom and one oil. I find it the RenoLock matchup like 50\/50 but everything else its just nearly impossible to get a win.","1262":"Or you can attempt to take a longer-than-normal control route with the Oil deck, until you get to a point where your reach can decimate their health before they would think to pop Reno.","1263":"If you play Aggro you beat them before they draw reno. If you play control, your card quality should be higher and you should win the game regardless of a big heal that doesn't affect the board.","1264":"Play Midrange Combo Druid.  The deck absolutely farms Reno decks because the minion quality is much higher and you can easily burst them with a huge combo.  It's not uncommon for them to heal to 30 and then just die the next turn because they spent 6 mana for a 4\/6 instead of clearing your board.","1265":"This x100. Midrange or taunt druid is the way to go. ","1266":"but those damn force of natures are so expensive to craft... still havent pulled one from a pack","1267":"Play a little like you do against Handlock.  When you're fighting a Handlock you know that if you bring them too low, they're going to drop Moltens, taunt up, and maybe even toss in a Healbot to add insult to injury.  So instead you bring them to a certain point and burn them out in one turn.\n\nThe same applies to Reno, except there's no specific number to work around and you don't need to stop attacking face.  You just don't want to blow any kind of burst damage until you can kill them in one turn, especially in a deck with finite and specific damage.\n\nNow, some decks just don't have any burst either due to class cards or lack of room for them.  The way to fight Reno with one of these decks is to make it so Reno won't save them.  For instance, as Flood Zoo you can lay out a board full of minions, Reliquary Seekers, and top it off with Loatheb.  Now it doesn't really matter if he drops Reno or not, it didn't do anything about your winning board state.\n\nThat said, if you're playing Oil Rogue, you should easily be able to build up ~15 damage of burst in hand.  Oil Rogue is particularly favored against most variants of Paladin since healing doesn't prevent burst, only armor does, and Rogue has many answers to Silver Hand Recruits.  I can't imagine this changes against Reno Paladin when played correctly.\n\nThe bottom line is, a Reno deck seeks to win through either value or fatigue.  Rogue can't win either of these games.  You have to take control and make the game about tempo, because if you start making anti tempo plays, you hand the advantage back to your Reno opponent.","1268":"I just want to bask in the glory of this problem!\n\nNo offense to the OP, but for us control players, we have waited a long time for this!","1269":"It has begun... once fun and original, now the complain train has started, 2 month and we are at the \"blizzard doesnt care\" stage","1270":"This thread isn't a complaint thread, it's an advice thread on how to counter a deck.

Overall, I think Sky was nice to give LS the money, but the issue had nothing to do with him and he only did it for attention (plus streaming the conversations with these guys just adds to it). I still think he's a very funny guy and a great player and I enjoy watching his stuff.","1286":"> but I just don't understand why he would stream that.\n\nBecause it's an investment in his league personality. And if you want this investment to be profitable, you need people to know about it. How do you do that? You need their attention. How do you get that? Stream the whole thing. He got a lot of viewers, some subscribers, an even more positive image because he was the nice guy who solved all that.\n\nIf you want to make a living of being a YouTubes\/Streamer\/etc. you need to stay relevant in the scene.\n\nAnd being nice also played a role. Showing Ocelote in a bad light because he mocked homosexuality was a nice side effect I guess?","1287":"I guess it was. And I get your point, for sure. I don't know, maybe it's just me, I just don't agree with the way he handled the problem, just by sticking his nose up and making it his problem even though he had absolutely nothing to do with it in the first place. He played the hero and it wasn't even his issue. But you're right, if you want to be successful in this scene, you gotta do what you gotta do. He saw the opportunity and took it and it paid off. I just don't know how Ocelote felt after that, he won a lot of haters after that conversation. At least for me, he came off as a complete douche and I really disliked his attitude and the things he said.

And it happens all the time. \n\nI only point this out because not one of the thousands of glowing, 10\/10 reviews I have read has ever mentioned this pretty big oversight.

There's a growing voice that is attempting to shift the blame away from religion and towards human nature.\n\nI can't tell you how many times I've seen the old, \"There are plenty of nice theists. It's not the religion, it's the individual person. There are also mean, bitter atheists.\"\n\nSure, that entire quote is completely true. It's also COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. We KNOW that people can be assholes regardless of declared philosophy. We KNOW that being irrational doesn't mean that somebody lacks empathy or compassion. We KNOW that being religious, or non-religious doesn't make you a better person. These are all beside the point.\n\nThe point is, sometime, we will have to work together. That's why we have rationalism in the first place. IF we can agree on the facts, then we can move forward and cooperate together towards common goals. Faith just fucks up the whole system. You can't refute, verify, test, or quantify faith claims. Faith allow erroneous, irrelevant, asinine, uninformed, inaccurate, sometimes helpful, sometimes harmful claims to pass as \"justified\" and it shouldn't.\n\nThe only way we can communicate ideas is through reason and faith is unreasonable.\n\nTheism is a just a particular subset of non-rational world-views. It's just a flagship issue for a larger problem. We need to be rational, else the best we can hope for is lucky guesses.\n\nPeople can be bad or good but that doesn't erase the philosophical issues with anti-rational stances.","1447":"No, people with religion are the problem.","1448":"No people who have closed their minds for whatever reason are the problem.\n\n(including atheists)","1449":"Being open minded does not mean placating religious people, though.

I must fully consider their points in order to refute them.","1450":"It is not religion that is the problem, it is dogmatic thinking.\n\nMost people practice religion in a way that encourages dogmatic thinking, and that is a problem. But I have encountered many religious people who are very open to discussion. In the end, the only thing you can not get them change views on is their belief in god, but they are open to nearly everything else.","1451":"People can be closed minded about a great many things, but I don't see how that is the problem of religion or atheism.  In fact, most atheists that I have heard talk on the subject are atheists because they are open minded.

So if people made religion how can religion be the problem?","1454":"Look, I am agnostic, but I think your entire take here is just too angry for me not to comment.\n\nYes, religion has done a lot of bad. And yes, there are a lot of religions that encourage a lot of bad things.\n\nThis does not mean that all religions are bad. Nor does it prove that religion is bad for society.\n\nThere are religions (and versions of Christianity) that actually thinking, questioning, self-reflection, etc. \n\nThe line of logic here does not hold, because it singles out religion for failings that exist in general. If anythings, this suggests that the common denominator: people are the problem.","1455":"People use religion as a justification for terrible ends. The problem is, religion has no way to self-correct. Because they have no real basis in reality, religions can be twisted.\n\nWe need to recognize that religions are just humans constructs, and bad ones. They don't add anything to our understanding. Religion is the way to justify your pre-conceived notions without any connection to reality.","1456":"","1457":"I totally agree. Religion is problematic. It can be good and it can be bad, but it's always unreasonable.","1458":"No, religion is the problem.\n\nAs you stated, people can be good without religion.

However there is a difference you made in your statement which breaks the analogy in mine. You have generalized the behavior to all members of society, rather than the individual performing the act. Each member of society which does an evil thing because that evil thing is the law of that society has been made a worse person by their adherence to that law, and by that society.\n\nThere are many ways to be evil. The existence of one does not excuse another. We should not settle for either. I will not follow a religious command to murder my son, nor a legal one. In the case of law, most of it is useful and some of it is not. It can be fixed when needed, the broken law replaced with a good one. In the case of religion, none of it is useful and most of it is harmful. It should be discarded whole, and replaced with nothing.","1463":"I would greatly disagree that everything about a religion should be discarded. There are many aspects to religion that are very wise and are worth keeping, though not necessarily within the context of the divine.\n\nCase in point. Confession. The act of admitting you are wrong and asking for forgiveness. Very good thing. Forces you to acknowledge your mistakes and take ownership (and hopefully do something about them.) Do you need to confess to God? no. I just think before we reject religions outright, we should mine them for the useful bits.","1464":"> There are many aspects to religion that are very wise and are worth keeping\n\nName one that isn't a secular value common to all civilizations everywhere.\n\n> Case in point. Confession.\n\nSecular. Religious confession has historically involved pears of anguish, hot pokers, pedophelia, inquisitions, and witch hunts. Oh, and of course bribes. I assume this is not the values you are extolling as good.\n\nConfession in a legal sense is a secular value that predates the religion. The religion had to include it to even pretend it was moral. Nobody believed the religions who said you could do whatever you wanted and not tell anybody and that was good if you didn't get caught. A certain level of secular morality is a requirement for any kind of civilization, religious or not. If the Jews had thought it okay to murder each other the whole time they were wandering the desert before they got the first set of stone tablets, they wouldn't have made it that far.","1465":"Theism is a problem because, at it's core, it's unverifiable. Religious claims are unfounded assertions; the best we can hope for is that they promote people to do good things for the wrong reasons.\n\nWe need to investigate religious commandments. Just because a religion encourages some positives (such as philanthropy, charity, humilty...etc.) doesn't excuse the negatives.","1466":"No objection.","1467":"Societies that provide social assistance to all citizens are demonstrably healthier than those that do not.

For example, the solution to our economic instability? More socialism at the Wall Street level (stop electronic front running) and more capitalism at the small business level (eliminate the payroll tax). \n\nIt is ignorance to assume one side has all the solutions and the other side caused all the problems. But to further the cause of making you feel persecuted (cause I know American Conservatives get off on that), conservatism is generally a desire to return to a previous situation or at minimum maintain our current situation.

I have been a little bit weary of the company since we started our dealings with them due to lateness, bad communication, etc. but this is starting to set off alarms.\n\nOnce we are moved in, things are smooth over the next couple of months as our dealings with the company's representatives are minimal however, last week my brother (whose name the rent bank account is in) looks at a PDF rendering of our December 2015 and January 2016 rent cheques and notices that someone from the rental company has changed the payee on the cheques and signed MY initials.\n\nThis causes both my brother and I a fair bit of outrage as you can all imagine.  We decide that we do not want to deal with this company any further.  My brother has opened a fraud investigation with the bank and they have agreed that the initials look forged and are willing to credit back the cheques to our account.\n\nMy question to you all is:  While our lease is set to expire at the end of April, what are the possible outcomes if we decide to hold the December and January rents hostage (charged back to our rent account) in order to force the company's hand and terminate our lease at the end of February?\n\nWould a rental company go to court over ~$3300?\n\nAny input is appreciated!","1553":"I don't think you should hold rent. It ultimately doesn't matter who the payee is as long as you have receipts that you've paid rent to the correct party. \n\nBut it sounds like forgery is good leverage if you want to leave by the end of February (while still paying Dec\/Jan rent). And it might be indicative of greater fraud going on somewhere.\n\nIt's good you reported it to your bank, because it's super weird. In the US, at least, there's a legal, easy way to pass a check to someone else without forging anything. WTF.","1554":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/legaladvice","1555":"Honestly, holding your rent just makes it sound like you're trying to get free housing.  I'm not trying to accuse you of anything but it doesn't look good to a judge who might end up deciding your fate given the possibility of someone pursuing legal action for unpaid rent.  Sure, messing with the checks is bad but 2 wrongs don't make a right.  Just make sure everything you do is above board and not equally underhanded as the landlord.\n\nThink of it this way, if your checks are properly coming out of your account and the business transactions continue, no harm no foul.  Maybe the landlord claims there was a mix up with the checks and maybe he's cleared of wrong doing.  You are now appear to be a deadbeat tenant.","1556":"I am not currently holding my rent - we have paid rent for both December and January.

It's a liability.  You should try to work through the issues with the landlord and stay until the lease is up.  Once it's up, feel free to not renew.

You charge back those cheques and you still owe them those 2 month's rent. Also, if you're dealing with the same people who changed the signature on your cheques then you need to go above their heads because it's very possible they're pocketing your rent payments and the company is about to come down on you for non-payment anyways. So basically you need tell them about the discrepancy, let them know you plan to charge back those cheques and then give them new ones. All that is independent of early termination of your lease agreement.","1561":"What makes you think that you don't owe rent for those months?  Yes, of course they can go after you if you proceed with a charge back.\n\nChange option 3 to \"Present them with a choice to void the lease or you will proceed with a criminal investigation for forging initials on your checks.\"  If the issue is still in question when your next rent is due, you place rent into an escrow account that will be delivered to them once the legal issues are resolved.

For good faith, do not wait for them to contact you.\n\n2.  You rental office made a fraudulent change to a check.  Confront them on that issue.\n\n3.  You have a lease you don't like.

If so, I would try to contact the company first and verify they have received your rent.

Forgery aside, you need to pay your rent. If you have any issues with how your rental has been managed, bring it up through the proper legal channels, contact the appropriate landlord and tenant agency in Ontario. Withholding rent is *never* an acceptable solution and puts you immediately in the wrong. Look at the provisions in your lease for early termination and follow them. You signed a contract and it's still valid.","1567":"Not sure how it works in Canada, but here in the US you can turn your rent checks into small claims court (I think) and they will withhold them from your landlord\/rental company until whatever issue it is is resolved.

Increased competition. Prices did rise, but then competitors made $1 menus and such, McD's followed suit to stay competitive.  \n3. They advertise the dollar menu, but know that most people may go in for the value, but be swayed by the other items.  \n4. Computers and automation have allowed a lot of streamlining of their product chains and food production, other lower costs means they didn't need to raise prices as much.  \n5. People pay attention to the main food item to judge cost, so having the $1 menu makes people perceive the whole place as less expensive than it is.  \n6. People rarely buy just a sandwich.

When I was little I remember seeing some scenes from the Shinning and full metal jacket but I was to young to appreciate good filmmaking. I just bought an 8 disc bluray box set of his work. I'm beyond excited!\n\nEdit: So thanks to Reddit, I've decided my Stanley Kubrick marathon is going to start with Full Metal Jacket tonight!","1745":"Paths of Glory is my personal favorite. It's an anti-war drama that'll hit you hard; at least it did for me. I'm pretty sure it's his shortest too. Can't recommend it enough. ","1746":"Came here to say the same.\nStart with Paths of Glory, and go chronologically by when they were made to see how he changed.","1747":"This is a really tough question but I would say Dr. Strangelove or Full Metal Jacket.","1748":"I think Full Metal Jacket is the way to go.\n\nThe film is pretty straightforward as far as Kubrick goes, you can finally see R. Lee Ermey's entire performance in all it's glory, and it is arguably one of the greatest Vietnam War movies made so far.","1749":"I wanted to know why the only movie he directed in my lifetime was in 1999, looked it up, heart attack in his sleep.. He was working on AI: artificial intelligence before he passed, crazy! That's like one of my favorite Spielberg movies.","1750":"AI was outstanding and very underrated. I almost never hear of this film outside of Reddit and most people have either never seen it or don't remember it coming out.","1751":"I remember it! It was pretty alright when I saw it, but it didn't stick, people weren't talking about it, there was no buzz after.","1752":"Dr. Strangelove, Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, 2001.\n\nI honestly just never liked The Shining, I think it's just Shelly Long tho.","1753":"Best order. Strangelove is a great warm up to the next three and Clockwork Orange is a good break from the war theme. Might be a little depressing by the end of Jacket but this was the order I was going to choose.","1754":"I kind of figured on scaling up the seriousness. If Strangelove isn't the funniest movie ever made its in the top five. While Clockwork isn't really a comedy IMO it is very funny. FMJ is just a great film, period. 2001 is something else entirely though, I've probably seen it 4 or 5 times and could not describe it to you.","1755":"A Clckwork Orange is funny that way, I see it as a straight comedy. ","1756":"Full Metal Jacket, to me, is his most accessible work. ","1757":"I would agree.  FMJ would be a good introduction.  I would then get into A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and then 2001.","1758":"2001, it's pretty straightforwrd. ","1759":"Watched it end to end on LSD, have never been so terrified and amazed in my entire life.","1760":"Dr. Strangelove","1761":"Is Spartacus in it? If so start with that. Still one of the greatest sword and sandal epics ever made.  ","1762":"Start with The Killing and go chronologically forward. Then if you really want more, go back and watch his first two features, which have a decidedly lesser reputation. ","1763":"Barry Lyndon is my personal favorite Kubrick film. The cinematography is gorgeous and the story is pretty good too. I was captivated by it from the first few minutes. \n\nBut as your first, maybe The Shining or Full Metal Jacket, but I honestly wouldn't jump directly into a movie like 2001.\n\nAs for Dr. Strangelove, I like it, but not as much as his other stuff. ","1764":"In his young years he was a great photographer.  I would also recommend 2001:a space odyssey.","1765":"Definitely not first. It's a great flick but is better after warming up to Kubrick's style.\n\nMuch like Life Aquatic is much better after watching Royal Tenenbaums or Bottle Rocket.","1766":"The Shining, Full Metal, A Clockwork Orange, Eyes wide shut.","1767":"Hard to say, their all great. Maybe Clockwork Orange.","1768":"Full Metal Jacket","1769":"Jacket is the best place to start. It's kind of like wading into a pool to get used to it.\n\nFrom there Clockwork since you can ride the high from Jacket to get you through it. After you pick up your jaw you can recover with Strangelove.\n\nThe Shining can be appreciated after you see those three followed by 2001. 2001 is such a substantial film that I believe you need to develop a taste for the work that goes into his films.","1770":"It depends on how much of a film fanatic you are I think.  No matter what all of his films are pretty terrific, but people recommending dr. Strangelove for an introduction to him I think are crazy.  The most normal films to give you a taste of what he does as a film maker would be Full Metal jacket, The Shinning and Eyes Wide Shut.  I would then go for 2001 then a clock work orange and if you find those all enjoyable I would then move on to things like Dr. strangelove.  Ya it's known as Asteroidea, but it's black and white and slow paced.  Again, if you're super into film that may not be an issue, but to me it's just not a good way to introduce someone to a director if they have never seen a film of his. ","1771":"The Killing","1772":"*Dr. Strangelove* is my favourite but you could also try *Full Metal Jacket* or *The Shining*?","1773":"Fear and Desire (his first feature) isn't great. And given the fact he wanted the film destroyed after making it means he himself doesn't class it in his oeuvre but watching his films in order for the first time could be an interesting experiment. \n\nTo see his career develop over the years through fresh eyes... It would be like being alive and watching each film as they were released.  ","1774":"A Clockwork Orange or Full Metal Jacket are two perfect gateways into his filmography, even though I'm not the biggest fan of Full Metal Jacket. I would recommend The Shining but I think it's cool to see what he does with the horror genre after you familiarize yourself with his style. ","1775":"Well the two that you listed are actually probably the best starting points. The Shining is one of the most famous horror movies ever, so a lot of people watch it without knowing who Kubrick is and still enjoy it. And Full Metal Jacket is fairly straight-forward, but everything is done right so it's also a good call. Clockwork Orange might also be a good idea, if you can handle the violence.\n\nFilms NOT to start with would be Lolita, 2001, Eyes Wide Shut and Barry Lyndon.\n\nAlso, I think I have the same boxset as you (Visionary Filmmaker Edition). It's a very good deal for anyone who is interested, but to other people in the comments, it doesn't include Dr Strangelove or Spartacus (I think one edition does include Paths of Glory, but mine doesn't). So recommendations of those films aren't really practical.\n\nHope this helps","1776":"The Killing \/ Eyes Wide Shut. My two favorite Kubrick films. And two films that I can't recommend enough.","1777":"Dr Strangelove and a clock work orange are my two personal favorites, you also can't go wrong with the shining","1778":"the shining is fairly accessible in my opinion","1779":"Start with Dr Strangelove and end there.","1780":"[Merry Christmas guys!](http:\/\/imgur.com\/b4kxQsA)","1781":"Ha.

Unfortunately, I became very seriously ill (hospital, CAT scan, so sick I couldnt even use the internet!) over the weekend and was rather obviously forbidden from flying by my doctor. \n\nMy awesome mom took the lead and went down to the airport before my flight with documentation from my doctor and spoke to a customer service rep who assured her it wouldn't be any issue at all, said he was updating the information with a future fictitious date to keep the reservation open, and to call the 800 number to choose a new flight whenever I was well enough to return home. Mom leaves feeling great, shares the good news with me, and I spend the rest of the week slowly recovering, at least grateful that was one thing I didn't have to worry about.\n\nFast forward to today: After finally getting approval to fly from my doctor I spent an hour on the phone (much of it on hold) trying to get a flight back this weekend so I can go to work on Monday. \n\nLo and behold, first they say they have no record of the flight being anything other than a no show--luckily my mother had written down the name and time of the rep she had spoken to, at which point they change their story to \"oh, we have notes about it here, but not of the note your mother brought in, so that'll be $150 change penalty.\"After I argue on this point, since I have the letter right in front of me and the agent had seen it at the time, they agree to waive that, but at the very last step after choosing flights I am told it will be $270 due to fare differences because I am booking less than 14 days out, regardless of this being a rebooking of a medically delayed reservation. \n\nLook, I get you they need to make money somewhere, and that tickets typically cost more closer to the day of, but is screwing over sick people really the policy stance your company wants to have? The actual cost of me flying last Tuesday versus this weekend should be negligible to the airline, especially since there were many open seats available. \n\nI am so frustrated on the principle of the matter that I am considering booking a long haul bus back instead. Make me feel better about it by telling me when airlines have taken an already painful and stressful situation and made it worse.\n\nTL;DR: American Airlines hates sick people, disgusts me so much I will probably take a 30+ hour bus ride just to avoid giving them another dime. \n\nEdit: spelling","1839":"Seems to be about a certain policy of theirs which would make it a systematic victimization.

You guys are great!","1855":"Do not get Runaans.\n\nAlmost never get Shiv.\n\nGet PD.\n\nShiv is highly situational and not an item I would recommend as standard. It can work, especially in high crit situations or AD split push situations. But in general PD is the best option, so until you feel comforable changing your build around to suit your team comp, stick with PD.","1856":"Runaans on Twitch (big maybe i dont like the item that much :D) poison stacks on multiple targets so it can work.\n\nRunaans also works on,Varus,Kog Maw and Graves (but you don't want it on graves, he needs that AD :D)\n\nShiv if you want to push your lane also works on hit like ezreal Q.\n\nPD for a great synergy with IE + high single target dmg.\n\nAlso you can check out www.reignofgaming.net they are running a lot of math for stuff like this.\n\nIn generell i dont buy Runaans ever.\n\nShiv if i have to push fast \/splitpush (but endgame most of the time i sell it and get a PD)\n\nAnd PD is my go to adc attack speed item (beside the new Botrk damn strong) it just grants you such good bonus stats :D","1857":"Your default item if you want to buy an as item as your second dps item should be shiv. While it provides less raw stats then pd, the proc damage vastly outweighs the damage that the extra stats provide, as well as provideing some extra aoe to help with wave clearing. If you are on your third or forth damage item however, go for pd due to the multiplicitive effect of the extra stats now being more benificial then the proc (and if you don't have a last whisper, strongly consider buying that instead of more as items).\n\nRunaans is a highly situational item for an adc. If you are purely splitpushing and not getting into fights or if their team is consistantly getting clumped together so that you can hit multiple targets with it, it can be a usefull pickup, but you are tradeing single target dps for a higher total, but spread out across multiple targets damage, which is not generaly what you want the adc on your team for.","1858":"Runaan's is good for splitpushing and for teams that group together a lot. PD is still the supreme AS\/Crit Chance item, but Shyv gives good stats with a strong early\/mid passive, while also building out of avarice blade to help mitigate the costs and make farming more effective. \n\nI usually get IE>Shyv>Hurricane on Trist because I like split pushing with her (shyv proc, hurricane, and E passive clear creeps really quickly) and people understand that if you are farming like crazy bot lane, then when you come to fights you'll dominate. \n\nHurricane's great on twitch because it works with his ultimate. PD is really strong as well, because of the crit chance it gives and people usually run IE on him. Shiv is alright, but it's a preference item. \n\nIt's not very good on Draven because spinning axes does not apply to the extra bolts, so you want to focus on single target burst with him. ","1859":"Hurricane really isnt that great in most situations. It just costs too much. As an ad it takes a long time to build one, and you can forget it if you are behind.\n\nShiv is a great cheap alternative to Phantom Dancer.\n\nOn trist, you  may want to opt for the shiv or a botrk. Shiv is cheap attack speed and crit, while botrk gives her a better mid game. If your doing extremely well due to her excellent early game, i'd go IE+zeal into PD. \n\nI'd say draven benefits more from raw damage. PD is probably idea, but I think Botrk is a better alternative to shiv personally.\n\nTwitch benifits from crit a lot, but he does take a while to get there. Shiv is great for early on with him. It allows him to quickly apply poison to the whole wave, and if he can opt to hang onto the avarice blade for a while to go for IE or something. He's the only of the 3 ad you mentioned that I'd be willing to buy hurricane on if I was way ahead AND they had the enemy team was the type that groups up in team fights. Hurricane has a small range, so its really hard to make use of..\n\nOverall, it comes down to your playstyle and a per-game situational basis.","1860":"Runaans sucks.  Its AoE is too small and late game ADs really really care about single target damage over AoE since a lot of it is spent fighting isolated bruisers.\n\nShiv gives higher burst and PD gives higher sustained damage especially as the game drags on.  When to get which is almost entirely preference based right now.","1861":"I generally dislike Runaan's because it doesn't help you kill enemy champions.

Thank you!","1996":"","1997":"Mechanical clocks and watches had a power source which drove wheels around, which were regulated and geared to give the desired result.\n\nFor example, a longcase clock (more commonly called a grandfather clock) was powered by weights. Widing the clock up meant (literally) winching the weights up to the top of the case. Gravity then pulled them down, but they weren't in freefall: a mechanism called the \"escapement\" stopped the weights falling too fast, trapping the wheel they were driving and releasing it only briefly. [This diagram](http:\/\/www.tag-web-design.com\/websites\/marklavertonclocks\/Resources\/bwancescapement.jpg) shows an example of one type of escapement: as the pendulum swings from side to side, the \"anchor\" also swings from side to side, trapping the escapement wheel with each \"pallet\" in turn. Here's [a video of a longcase clock escapement in action](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wkO0iO5QC1M), and here's [a much more detailed video explaining how the escapement actually drives the pendulum](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z_7rE8afFfo) (because perpetual motion is not a thing).\n\nIn a longcase clock, the pendulum is roughly a metre long: in our gravity, anything a metre long will swing side to side in one second. Smaller clocks will have shorter pendulums which will swing faster, but everything is geared so that the hands move at the correct speed.\n\nSmaller clocks and watches will be powered by springs rather than weights: winding up one of these timepieces means tightening the spring, which then tries to unwind -- again, the escapement makes sure it unwinds at a specific speed. Anything too small to have a pendulum can instead be regulated by a balance wheel. It has its own spring, and as the clock mechanism tries to turn the balance wheel one way, it springs back and turns the other way. This means that the balance wheel -- and therefore the escapement -- oscillates at a very predictable rate.","1998":"By how long it took a pendulum to swing back and forth. Or by how long it took a spring to, uh, spring up and down. But, of course, those weren't necessarily exactly one second, so the clockmaker had to work out a mechanism to use *one swing every three seconds* (or whatever the figure turned out to be) to keep time.","1999":"They didn't 'know' anything; rather the gears were constructed in a way to make sure that by charging a spring by winding it, or by pulling up weights that would slowly fall, it would move gears at a speed that correlated to a second, minute, hour, day. \n\nSet it up and let it run; if it is off after a day or two, adjust until you get it right. Eventually, the clock-makers had other good, calibrated clocks around, so would just need to make sure that it ran properly for a few mintues. ","2000":"Certain things move in a regular motion that has a stable frequency over time. A Pendulum swings back and forth at a fixed rate (or frequency - number of times over a given period of time). A spring will oscillate at a fixed rate. The magnitude of the motion - how far the pendulum swings - will become less as energy leaves the system, but the frequency of the oscillation is fixed. Think of a tuning fork. It can be louder or quieter but the frequency at which it vibrates is always the same.  \n\nThat regular motion is used to drive a mechanism called an [escapement](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Escapement) which is used to turn the gears of the clock. In simplest terms the escapement is responsible for counting the cycles of the pendulum or spring.   \n\nThe pendulum goes back and forth at a given rate, say 4 times per second, and the escapement counts the number of times. Between the two of them you have a clock. This is fundamentally how all clocks work.  \n\nThis isn't confined to old clocks. The watch I'm wearing right now has no electronics in it, just springs and gears. It has a tiny spring in it that oscillates 6 times per second, which drives an escapement which drives the motion of the hands. This is not uncommon.  ","2001":"From Wikipedia: \n\nIn the year 1000 CE, the Persian Muslim scholar al-Biruni first used the term second in Arabic (\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 thaniyah) and defined it as 1\u204486,400 (that is,  1\/(24 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 60)) of a mean solar day.\n\nI.e. the length of a day is a (nearly) constant thing, even back at the dawn of civilization. Hours, minutes, seconds are just divisions of that time. \n\nClocks and other timekeeping measure have all attempted to track that time, and you could tell how accurate your clock was if it lined-up correctly with the length of a day. Often by tracking High-noon (sun at it's apex) or by careful observations of stars. \n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Second","2002":"Hello everybody, my ign is Godshot recently I got back into my gold 1 promos and i won one and then lost one.

","2037":"Sorry for the novel :D\n\nHello \/r\/relationships[1] !\n\nI am not sure what to do anymore and thought I should post here for some advice.\n\nBackground: I was in a very exhausting relationship last year. It was the first time both of us were in a serious relationship and she got clingy almost instantly. We hung out literally everyday just watching youtube videos in my dorm room. One time I told her I was going somewhere, and she said she'll just wait for me in my dorm room... alone. I sometimes used to lie to her just so I can escape and actually have fun with my friends, heck it was my freshman year at college! She was also straight-edge, which isn't a bad thing but she would always judge me and my friends for drinking\/smoking.\n\nShe was just so dependent on me because of family issues too so I couldn't even break up with her at the time. Her clingy-ness has changed my outlook on relationships as I feel like every relationship is like that. I sometimes like to have alone time and to me you can't do that in a relationship. Whenever someone gets in a relationship, I feel as though they kind of like fuse together since they are always together.\n\n\n\nOk so fast-forward to a year later and I meet this really cool girl at a friend of mine's dorm party. I thought she was really hot and when we hooked up I almost couldn't believe it. We started texting and meeting up once in a while and hooking up. We didn't really make future plans and it was kind of like a friends-with-benefits situation.\n\nAfter about 2 month of hooking up, she finally asked \"Where do you see this going?\" I told her about my past relationship and that I just don't want to get in a relationship right now because of my suffocating ex. She seemed a bit hurt, but we kinda made up and everything seemed good at the time. We kept contact after school ended, even though I tried to limit the texting in order to not lead her on to a relationship. I thought it was just a hookup and didn't really care too much.\n\nI live on campus during the summer, and she told me she was going to be taking summer classes and that she will have a place over the summer. I went over to her place every week after my classes and we actually started to get kind of close and I started to like her more and more but we still only talked in person basically.\n\nThis is when things started looking a bit like a relationship as her friends kept referring to me as \"Jackie's BF\" and we were spending a lot of time together but I didn't care too much because I was only seeing her once a week rather than every second. Everything was dandy until yesterday when she basically said \"i can't do this anymore, i want a relationship\" to which I panicked and responded that I can't really take the next step. I think she was really hurt and we haven't really talked since. I can't help but think \"Did I do the right thing?\" every second of the day and I am looking for some advice\n\nWe have a lot of things in common and I really enjoy hanging out with her. However, she was also in a relationship for a long time and I'm afraid that it's going to have a similar ending. I was really miserable with my ex and I really don't want something like that again. I guess you can say I have commitment issues. Everyone has been giving me mixed responses and I am very confused on what to do.... Do I let her go and try to be friends with her later or actually attempt a relationship with her?\n\nTL;DR; : I [19M] have been seeing this girl [20F] for a couple of months but now she wants a relationship","2038":"You shouldn't let bad experiences from the past prevent you from experiencing happiness in the future. \n\n\nHow much do you like this girl? How happy does she make you? Would you be more miserable if you lose her? \n\n\nOne thing you need to realize is that \"being in a relationship\" means different things to different people. You need to communicate what it means to you, and ask her what it means to her. Does she want to be exclusive? Agree not to hook up with anyone else? Does she want to be able to openly call you her bf and her your gf? Does she want to spend more time together? \n\n\nIt sounds like you two are already acting like you're in a relationship, but you're scared of the label. Figure out what about it scares you. But keep in mind that just because the last girl got clingy doesn't mean this one will too.","2039":"Just adding to this: it seems like you really enjoy what you have with her right now. Being \"in a relationship\" doesnt have to change things dramatically. If you get along well, why not? But it is healthy to dicuss things like this with her aswell. Let her know that you didn't enjoy your previous relationship because your ex was too clingy. Hopefully she will take this into consideration and move a little slower with you","2040":"We already had a talk where I explained my past relationship and why I didn't want one. She knows all of it, and she says that she can't help but feel this way. I think she has been holding this in for a while","2041":"I think even if you aren't sure, give it a try anyway. I can't promise you, but I think you will enjoy this relationship a lot more than your previous one. ","2042":"Seriously, my ex and I broke up for the same reasons and I didn't want to get straight into another relationship just for it to be the same, but literally a month later I found my fiance. I wanted us to be just friends with benefits, but that never works out as you expect. Turns out he is perfect for me and made me realize how naive I was with my ex. Dont ruin something that could be great just because of an ex.","2043":"I really do like her.. I think I just need to meet with her and be completely honest. I think her main issue is that we don't spend a lot of time together and when we don't I don't really talk to her. As I said earlier, I kept this semi-awkward silence in order to not have her cling to me but now that I actually know her I'm not sure what I should do","2044":"Your ex isn't an example of a normal relationship. Unless you really suck at choosing women, it's pretty unlikely this girl will have the same issues as the last. \n\nShe'll come with her own set of problems. :)","2045":"funny thing is... there are certain characteristics that REALLY remind me of my ex, which makes me question whether I attract these types of girls","2046":"Either that, or you're subconsciously attracted to certain types of girls.\n\nLook, if she turns out to be an OAG, you can always break up with her. There is always an out.","2047":"From what I've read, you don't really understand what a relationship is.  Your first gf was not a typical relationship.  Matter of fact, relationships can mean different things to different people.  For all you know, this girl just could've wanted you 2 to be exclusive and not change any of your behavior.\n\nAlso, you base current\/future relationships on past ones.  What your ex gf did, has no influence on this girl or any other girls you might date.","2048":"I know you are right, yet I can't seem to stop it. I want to move on, but I also don't want to feel like the way I did","2049":"Talk to her about how you feel and what's on your mind. Be honest with her. Don't let your fears decide your fate.","2050":"I was thinking about texting her to meet up and talk about this but I'm a little scared","2051":"What are you scared of? ","2052":"I'm scared that she will not have a positive reaction. We did all of this through text and when I asked to meet up she said \"I'm sure neither of us want to do that\" even though I really did. ","2053":"Well, you have to. It's a part of growing up and having a relationship. It can be scary, but it's a very important experience and the award for it feels awesome. Don't be scared. If it happens, it happens, but at least you tried and learned! Unless you want to run from the situation, and grow up alone. Which sounds pretty boring. You have to sit down and talk to her. ","2054":"Here's the thing: This girl is not your Ex.  This wont play out the same way.  I think what you should do is take a moment and ask yourself this: Do you not want a relationship?  **or**  Do you not want the same kind of relationship you had with your Ex?\n\nI think you should talk to Jackie, and ask her what she would expect out of a relationship.  Maybe it'll be no different than where you already are besides the added point of acknowledging the commitment to eachother.  She's already aware of your past experiences and hasn't (as far as I see) given you any reason to expect her to be the same.

For example, Uranium-238 decays into Thorium-234. The rate of this decays depends on the stability of the nucleus, some take thousands or millions of years, some take hours or minutes.\n\nThe half-life is the time it will take for half of the original atoms to be decayed into the new atom: If you have 100 Uranium-238 atoms, the time it will take to decay to 50 Uranium-238 and 50 others.\n\n","2198":"Oh okay that makes sense now. Thanks man!","2199":"If you have one atom of a radioactive substance, then at any given moment it could suddenly decay - turn into another element and throw out some radiation in the process. This process is random, but the average time it takes for this to happen is the same for all atoms of the same substance[1]. There are a few ways to express that average time, but one way is to look at the time it takes to have a 50% chance of decaying, and that's a \"half-life\".\n\nIf you have a lot of atoms - say, on the order of trillions, then the random behaviour starts looking more like an average behaviour. So if you start with a trillion atoms, after one half-life the number that will have decayed is very close to half a trillion (and the difference probably isn't worth measuring). After two half-lives, another half of the remaining atoms will have decayed, leaving you with a quarter of a trillion atoms of the original substance and three-quarters of a trillion worth of decay products[2].\n\nFor a small number of atoms, there's a decent probability that it won't be a perfect half-half split - like flipping coins until they show heads, if you've only got two then it won't be too surprising to get double heads in one flip even if heads-tails is more likely. But if you flip a trillion coins, it would be overwhelmingly unlikely that the number of heads would deviate from half a trillion by more than, say, a hundred thousand. So as long as your numbers are big, you don't need to look too much at the random side of the process, just at the average.\n\n[1] Specifically, all identical *isotopes*, i.e. atoms with the same proton-neutron configuration.\n[2] Some of which may have their own decay patterns, making the total make-up of what you have at this point complicated.","2200":"The time it takes for half of the material to be depleted.

I initially wanted mATX but I'm pretty sure that mITX is a better option now. For this reason I'm going with EVGA's Hadron Air. I'm looking for other case options if you have an idea but please also suggest a PSU since the Hadron comes with its own.\n\n*CPU & Mobo:* I'm choosing Z97 chipset so that I can upgrade more easily to something a little better in the future. Also the added Wifi is a bonus. For now though, I'm pretty curious to see for myself how the G3258 will do, given it's great price. I mostly play Guild Wars 2, Minecraft, Skyrim and Planetside 2. I think Planetside 2 will be the most demanding thing I'll be doing with my system (maybe some CAD or 3D design work later) and I would like to be able to play it at least fairly well - 1080p, High, ~60 FPS - I don't need Ultra.\n\n*Budget:* My budget was initially $650-700 (pre S&H and taxes) when I was not thinking about size but after realizing I'd probably need mITX, my budget is $750 CAN (before shipping and taxes and MIR)\n\nIn the future, I'd like to add an SSD, install an aftermarket CPU cooler and upgrade the CPU and\/or GPU\n\nThanks for reading this far! I'll answer any questions or comments you have below :)\n\nP.S. Is is mITX or just ITX?","2264":"I think your graphics card will be capable of 60FPS at High 1080p, so a good choice there. The Pentium can be overclocked, but since you currently have the stock cooler I wouldn't take it too far. However, I'm no expert on overclocking so I suppose my opinion is a bit invalid. I like your case. It's the one I'll be getting, so I'm a bit biased towards it. :) I think you've got a solid system on your hands.\n\nNote: The motherboard is renowned for having rather breakable wifi-antennas. Be careful.","2265":"Thanks :)\n\nAbout the motherboard, I'll keep that in mind but right now it's set to the cheapest Z97 itx available (using the PCPartPicker parametric criteria tool) I'm also considering the [Gigabyte GA-Z97N-WIFI](http:\/\/ca.pcpartpicker.com\/part\/gigabyte-motherboard-gaz97nwifi)","2266":"ITX is basically just a shorter way of saying Mini-ITX.\n\nYou should recheck available GPU pricing , you can definitely get more for your money.

I start, first time doing surgery, never really been in hospitals much so of course you are anxious and feel vulnerable. Scheduled for hip surgery due to a torn labrum \u2013 so here it starts.\n\nAfter arriving you disrobe and put all your belongings in a bag. Naked just covered with a gown \u2013 lets face it - its not hiding much and adding to your level of un-comfortableness. Now some feedback ahead of time, I like to trim in my private area, my wife prefers a bit of manliness down there while I love the feeling of being \u201call trimmed\u201d. Its been a while since my last trimming So imagine me, tender white dude, all anxious about first surgery, laying there what I could only describe as butt-naked in the bed, in a big room that is separated by blinds, not separated well enough I think. For the purpose of comedy, imagine a big black man entering the room, equipped with the tool of our trade, a trimmer (ok he was black but not that large). He gets ready to do his thing. As part of the hip surgery all hair has to be removed around the area. As he starts to trim away he enters the borders of the private zone. My wife in all her innocence says \u201cWell Honey, isn\u2019t that what you always wanted?\u201d \u2013 Oh the terror. As the guy continued we exchanged eye contact for a brief second and I can only imagine what went on in his head, because mine said in an attempt to finish my wifes sentence \u201cyou mean a big black man shaving my junk\u201d. No words were spoken, but we both knew what was going on. Awkward\u2026\n\nNext, pre-op. Its eerie quiet in pre-op, just a bunch of people waiting to get cut open. Now like many others I have a thing with needles, but what you gonna do. So the anesthesiologist and his nurse come along. He comes over and says \u201cWe are going to have to give you a block into your back to minimize the pain after surgery\u201d \u2013 \u201cok, I have no idea what it is, but do you thing, I mean I cannot really say no right?\u201d. Now, when a doc comes to you and tells you about \u201csomething special\u201d I imagine it\u2019s not a simple procedure. I ask the doc if I am going to feel much, he said \u201cNah, we give you some stuff, you should not feel much\u201d (emphasis on should, the sweating starts).\n\nNurse comes along with a tray of 5 needles, the 5 needles were covered with a plastic bag. She picks it up the plastic bag and has a conversation \u201cOk I brought the 4-inch needle for the block\u201d. Now, said 4 inch needle looked extremely scary \u2013 that sucker was huge, not just the size but the width of the needle itself. It covered the entire tray. The doc responds \u201cWell, bring the 6 inch one instead, actually, no, get the 8-inch one\u201d \u2026. I was speechless. The nurse responds \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like the large ones as I sometimes go in too deep\u201d. At this point I am freaking out, wtf kind of process is this? The doc walks over to me, injects something into my IV and I am out \u2013 gone. \u201cYou idiots, why didn\u2019t you put me out 20 seconds earlier, I did NOT need to hear any of this\u201d.\n\nPost-op next, its around 2:00AM while I wake up for the first time. Drug induced with my leg connected to a machine that moves the leg constantly \u2013 just had surgery in that leg and the moving part is definitely not fun. She asked me \u201cHey, do you have to pee?\u201d \u2013 Now as you can imagine, peeing was the last thing on my mind \u2013 my main focus was on the pain thanks to said machine. I really did not feel like moving and having a nurse go into my private zone to pee while my right leg is moving up and down \u2013 an accident waiting to happen. \u201cNo I\u2019m good\u201d. She comes back at 3:00, \u201cHey, you have to pee?\u201d \u2013 \u201cnope all good thanks\u201d. She comes back at 4:00AM with a tea and a diet coke \u201cI brought you something to help you pee\u201d \u2013 \u201cNo I\u2019m good\u201d. She then responds \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t pee we have to put the catheter back in\u201d \u2013 now, I have heard this term before, but did not know what it meant until then. All of the sudden clarity in my brain came through and I just realized I had been violated \u201cCatheter back in?? WTH, I had no idea you guys put this in there, I looked the procedure up online and there was no mention of it\u201d. The nurse responds \u201cWell, I can imagine why they don\u2019t mention that part\u201d. I instantly reached for the bottle, stuck it down there, inserted the member and did my business \u2013 the fastest pee I ever had.\n\nEDIT: TL'DR: Dream fulfilled of being shaven by another man, 8 inch foreign object inserted into the back, unknowingly violated in the japs eye","2416":"The ending made me laugh. \n\nI guess mine would have to be \"We have to put him down.\" ","2417":"An old woman having some horrid diarrhea in the bed across from me.

The pain medication was just barely enough and I really wanted sleep.\n\nTL:DR In hospital with a broken collar bone - the guy in the next bed gets a hand job from his girlfriend.","2420":"My main for mid is Morgana, I also enjoy Anivia, sometimes I'll pick up brand. it really doesn't matter who I play as, though.\n\nLevels 1-5 I'm fine with last hitting, harassing. Though I do have a hard time killing him or forcing him B.\n\nLevel 6 comes along, though, and he just shits all over me. I even try backing off and playing super passive, but it seems like he can teleport to me from a further distance than I can be while still trying to last hit.\n\nKassadin is by *far* the matchup that gives me the most trouble. I'd love some advice on how to deal with him. I'd love to be able to win a lane against him, but even if not, if I could just not get rocked, that would be a step in the right direction.","2421":"You're not going to be able to beat an equally skilled Kassadin post-6 with most traditional AP mages if you don't punish him HARD early in the game.  You need a substantial CS lead, preferably a couple kills on him, and you need to make an impact in other lanes before he gets a chance to.  Remember to use both your abilities *and* AAs to harass him pre-6, he has limited poke as a melee champ with only one reliable ranged ability and ranged AAs are probably your best tool to keep pressure on him and dissuade him from farming.\n\nAlso make sure you work with your jungler.  Your jungler should know that Kassadin is almost ungankable after he gets his ult and that he's a huge threat if he gets any sort of lead.  He should pay special attention to your lane early and try and get at least one or two successful ganks off to get you going.","2422":"Well, u can try ad quints, hybryd pene marks, to punish him early in range vs melle matchup (u can aa, he dont). \n\nAfter 6 u should actualy still trade with him. I play anivia a lot and even after, if he jump on me with R and Q (im trying to stay farm from him so he cant do E dmg after R, and after silence go off, I fire back: R-E and try to hit my stun as well with 2nd E. Your base dmg is still better like his (to like lvl 9 or specialy 13 when kass get nice spike). If u cant trade anymore, just shove lane super fast from range and try roam while he clear, or just farm jungle (wolfs\/wraits) to get cs lead.\n\nIf he roam u cant rly follow, so just try push his tower and get more map control by that. Its hard to shutdown good kass, it more about jungler early pressure on lane and his blue buff control to slow him. \n\nCant talk much about itemization, early Negatron can help, but not sure if worth delaying other items (but if u gettting 100-0, its better to survive fight and deal some dmg\/cc)","2423":"I'll second some of this:  I go mana regen + as much AD as I can on runes as Anivia.  Then AA him every chance you can lvl 1 - 3\/4 to shove him out of lane.  He gets behind exp and CS.  ","2424":"Take him down pre-6 and make sure your E reflexes are good. If they are, you can turn around his R-Q combo because you wont be silenced and you can hit him with QW+AA's and it should do a pretty decent chunk of damage. Landing another QW should allow you to ult and kill him most of the time. If your not sure you can get your E's off in time, ask for early ganks. He can't really deal with them, and he can't exactly ask for ganks cause your Morgana and she's pretty much ungankable. \n\nAlso, constantly push. He can't push for squat so whenever he tries to roam, warn your teammates and shove the lane like mad. Often when I use Morg against a kassadin, his tower goes down SUPER early because he tried to roam and I pushed the tower hard. He can't farm under tower very well either so pushing him early has a ton of other benefits. \n\nOne item I like getting against Kass is Abyssal because it lowers his MR which is needed because of his passive and it also makes you more durable to his combos. So far this strategy has made Kassadins the fear of my life to a not-so-big-problem :-)\n\nhope it helps :D","2425":"I'm not the best ap mid player but RapidStar said to take Attack speed marks in order to deal with the silence. I haven't really played against Kassadin that much but hes kind of like TF in a sense that you need to shut him down before he gets his ult or else he just goes to other lanes and kills. I usually like to roam when I'm in a tough situation anyways so try roaming if laning doesn't work so you don't feed as much. ","2426":"DORANS BLADE START. \n\nSeriously, try it, bully that kassadin to no end, force him out of lane and end laning phase 30-50cs up. Works especially well if you're playing orianna\/lux because you can even sheild all his q damage while using both passives to your advtantage. It is super easy to come out ahead in lane like this but then after 6 its up to you to try to manage his roaming to other lanes. Albiet your team might lose the advantage you made against him and blame him being 'fed' on you. Has happened to me and is quite depressing. Because of this you can still win post 6 trades with him, anticipate his jump by popping your shield, then apply auto's\/spells when silence comes off cooldown and he wont be able to stay in lane.","2427":"You realize when you go up to harass him with autos he'll just throw a q on you and his minions will win the trade for him.\n\nYou have no sustain outside dorans blade plus no wards for jungle ganks.  Sounds like a pretty awful set up to me.","2428":"It's a very good start, you obviously haven't tried it yet so for you it's hard to judge. First off, you completely zone him from last hitting creeps because your auto\/shield pressure. When he does go for cs you can always get 1-3 autos off before he goes back and gets zoned again. Unless you're that incompetent starting dorans blade should be an easy lane win for you. The only trouble will be when he starts roaming because some certain members on your team forget that they are vsing a kassadin.","2429":"If I'm jungling and I see you started dorans blade and are pushing lane through harassing, I will sit on you so hard you'll cry.\n\nI have seen it done and guess what happened?  Kass being autoed at his torches at 1\/3 hp chugging pots.  Annie with dorans blade and ad reds at 3\/4 hp from q harass right by center of lane zoning kass.  Kass walks up, silences, j4 comes from jungle, knocks up annie.  Kass ignites and gets kill.  Guess who snowballs the game from there?

Further down the list Druid averages 6.82, Warlock 6.46, Shaman 6.30, Priest 6.23, Warrior 6.11 and Hunter 6.04. \n\nIn my experience, Mage and Rogue have been top tier arena classes since Hearthstone's release. Other classes have been there at some point, but have fallen down gradually or significantly after expansions and adventures. For example, back in the days, Warrior and Shaman were pretty solid! Paladin was considered to be a pretty weak arena class at some point. But since the release of TgT Paladin has gotten better and better. In TgT Paladin got Seal of Champions, Argent Lance and Murloc Knight. LoE gave them Keeper of Uldaman. \n\nSo depending on whether you want to just have fun or play to win in Arena (which often goes hand in hand), you'll pick a class accordingly. I myself and I think a lot of arena players who read this, have experienced picking and facing a lot of Rogues, Mages and Paladins in arena for quite some time now. Getting as far as possible and receiving those shiny arena rewards after, makes Arena fun for me. Therefore, I will pick Rogue, Mage or Paladin whenever I can (and so do a lot of others). Druid hangs in there too. \n\nI think this is a problem. Over half of the Arena classes statistically should *not* be picked, if you want to win the most games. The difference between winrates maybe doesn't seem that high if you look at the spreadsheet numbers, but in reality it means a lot to constantly win less games. Also, when playing for example Shaman or Priest, you feel so helpless playing against these Rogues, Mages and Paladins over and over again and rarely facing a Warrior. \n\nSo when Blizzard introduced A New Way To Play, they stated that a couple cards from the Classic and Basic set were being looked at (balancing wise). They also made clear Arena is not affected by the new Standard format, as Arena will be using all the cards, thus being in the Wild format.\n\nWe know that the latest released Hearthstone cards get offered more than other cards (percentage wise), so it's entirely possible that the new expansion will (drastically) change things (because new cards have a greater chance to affect the Arena meta because they get offered more). On the other hand, Rogue and Mage have been top tier Arena classes for such a long time and didn't really get affected negatively by later card releases (you could even argue that Rogue and Mage have benefited from them which added to their power). \n\nDo you guys share these concerns? Are you confident this next expansion will make for a better, more balanced Arena experience, with more variety in class picks? Please discuss in the comments. Thanks for reading!\n\nEdit: formatting","2461":"I'm sorry I'm not really contributing to your main subject (will the new expansion make it better?)  \nFor me a game is fun if it has variety. That's the main reason why I play more arena than constructed (actually since I hit legend for the first time I only play constructed because of the end of season rewards and golden heroes). What I don't understand is why people then only pick the best of the three offered classes. I play arena because I want variety, so I also want variety in the classes! It's so pleasant to draft a 10+win warrior deck!  \nI'm doing it like this: if I have a quest, then I pick the according class, otherwise I just pick the one on the most left.","2462":"it makes sense to pick the best class until you get to a point where you make more gold than you spend in arena","2463":"Sure, everyone has their own goals when playing Hearthstone. Whether it is to have fun, win, getting as far as possible with the least good classes. It's all good. \n\nThe main point I was trying to make was this: there are 3 dominant classes right now that get played the most in Arena (see the spreadsheet). It's because the Rogue, Mage and Paladin have the highest winrates. That means that a lot of people are trying to get as many wins as possible. Because of this, you rarely see other classes being played. That sucks. It would be so much better for the Arena to have more viable picks if you *do* want to get the maximum wins possible and earn the most gold. \n\nAt the end I asked whether the people from this subreddit believe the new expansion could change this. That wasn't the subject of the post, it was a way to ask for someone else's opinion on the matter and share my concerns with you all.","2464":"> For me a game is fun if it has variety.  \n> I also want variety in the classes!\n\nPulling out those quotes because they illustrate that you recognize that your own personal preference is not universal. Some players are motivated by winning above everything else. In MTG circles, those players are sometimes referred to as \"[Spikes](http:\/\/mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com\/Player_type#Spike)\" because Mark Rosewater has written fairly extensively about how different players play for different reasons.\n\nIn Hearthstone there are 2 major factors for why some players will always pick the class with the highest winrate. Either they're Spikes, or they feel pressured to not waste resources because Arenas cost gold or money to enter, and they feel like they can't afford to not tryhard when there's gold on the line.","2465":"I'm in my plat promotion and I honestly thing matchmaking wants me to fail by making me fight way higher teams.\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/u3MLZJx.png\nSo you can see there is a huge difference in divisons and leagues.

My computer is a Dell Vostro 3360, running Win 7. ","2669":"You can try and calibrate your battery (done in bios most often) but this is time consuming and requires it be plugged in.  In addition, I haven't seen it on newer laptops so it might not even be an option anymore.\n\nWhat is more likely happening is, most likely, that your power cord is on the fritz.  It has already probably done plenty of damage to your laptop.  The other poster said your battery is dying, however I do not believe this is the case - as typically it will just drain from 100 to 0 faster as it calibrates itself to the new maximum capacity.\n\nFor example - my wife's laptop (which is older than the one you have) would be unable to charge after her cord would stop supplying the appropriate voltage (while running).  If we left it powered off and plugged it in, it would get some charge but it destroyed the battery already so it lasts maybe 3 minutes (this was a few years ago, I'm not expecting a 5 year old battery to last very long but a young battery should).\n\nNo matter the case - if you have a dell, with dell installed software, you might have a thing called quick set which will automatically disable charging (to prevent the same issue my wife's had) when the voltage cannot be determined.  In addition, there is a rare chance that you (or someone else) disabled charging.\n\nYour best bet is to try a new power cord.  I would imagine your laptop isn't that old (Dell is still selling that unit) so you might want to check with dell as well, as this might be something they are better able to handle.  It may also fall under a warranty period and you may be able to get your battery and\/or cord replaced.  If it is found to be a defective cord, I highly recommend requesting a new battery to be safe.\n\nOf course, I could be completely wrong and it *could* just be the battery, but given my experience with problems incredibly similar to this one, I am going with the power adapter not supplying enough voltage to charge.","2670":"That might be true, but there is still a good chance the battery is dying. I've seen batteries only charge to a certain percentage before they die. I always recommend buying a new generic power adapter from you local electronics store as they usually only cost $20-$30. If it doesn't fix the problem then it's the battery or circuit board that charges the battery inside the laptop.","2671":"True, and if they are particularly smart about it, they can identify it as the problem by buying the charger and returning it as \"I don't need it\" if it works, or if it fails, and trying to get the power adapter replaced otherwise.\n\nEither way, what is happening to the battery will kill it one way or another, so if it wasn't dying, it probably is now.  But, if it is the battery (solely) I learned something b\/c I have never seen a newer battery not charge to capacity in windows without it being an adapter\/voltage issue.\n\nEither way, always start small with things cheap and easy to replace.  So start with the adapter, then the battery.  And make sure to call dell to assess the warranty status.  You may even be able to extend your warranty retroactively if necessary (not sure).","2672":"Your battery appears to be dying","2673":"Try this: http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/forum\/windows_7-hardware\/after-installing-windows-7-on-hp-laptop-getting\/8f41bb6e-3702-4dd3-8d34-d5a4d1cff915","2674":"I tend to play new champions without reading a guide on them in PVP games (not ranked).

Skyrim looks great, and certainly the combat is better, but I felt like the quests and worldbuilding were lackluster, and a lot of the action devolves into clearing out samey-looking crypts full of draugr over and over again.\n\nAnd honestly? You might want to take a look at Morrowind again. It may be too dated for you to appreciate still, but that game is considered by many to have all the depth of Oblivion, and then some. ","2713":"Morrowind was epic in comparison to oblivion and skyrim. The graphics arent as good but thats about it.\n\nSkyrims leveling and skill system didnt feel as good as oblivion or morrowind.\n\nI loved skyrim. I just wish i could get my morrowind and oblivion discs to work. Oblivion got all scratched up sadly. Ill probably end up buying them on steam","2714":"The number next to \"The Elder Scrolls\" is inversely proportional to the complexity of the game itself.  This is not entirely a bad thing, as the systems implemented to generate a more believable experience improved the quality of the games dramatically.  If you take Daggerfall, for instance, (Arena was similar) it is simply MASSIVE in scale, covering an area that games today still aspire to build.  Unfortunately, it was either static content (a few story-critical dungeons and towns) or completely RNG.  You could go back to the same spot twice and things would be completely different.  So yes, you had scale... you had exponentially more complexity (you could literally make spells that were the equivalent of the \"I WIN\" button with the right knowledge of how to do it), but mostly it was soulless.\n\nEnter Morrowind.  It's main questline was multitudes better than Oblivion and Skyrim.  It retained a much more complex skill and spell system, and generally was an improvement over Daggerfall.  It took out some of the needless scale and fluff, pushing the game engine to its limits without shackling the player to non-godlike status.  If you could dream it up, you could, in some way, make the spell and equipment that turned your playstyle into an absolute beast.  Still, however, the world felt a bit static.  It was beautiful, but NPCs were still along the lines of the classic \"stand there and hand out quests and information\" type.  Morrowind was like this giant playground based around the game engine with a fantastic set of plots (albeit buggy at times)\n\nOblivion changed that, adding Radiant AI.  This woke the world up and the NPCs actually did stuff.  It's now a given that a TES world will have a lot of things going on.  Encounters became less random and more emergent.  It did this, however, at the expense of game complexity.  NPCs were a bit more sentient and the player had to play by the same rules as the NPCs to make it anywhere near fair.  It was only a matter of time, and while Oblivion was a great game in its own right (I played hundreds of hours of it), it was far closer to the action RPG standard than the pen and paper RPG complexity of TES games before it.\n\nSkyrim cut the pen and paper fat further and added loads of great features that excited the masses.  It further distilled the experience into ARPG and I think it did this well.  But at this point, Skyrim is unrecognizable from its roots in Daggerfall and Morrowind.  It shares setting, story, and vision, but it is not the same game.\n\nIt is what it is... Oblivion and Skyrim were dumbed down for the masses and the 13 year old console gamers.  This age-old argument can be held elsewhere.  The fact for me, at least, is that all of the games represent the pinnacle of achievement for their respective generations.  I have played 400-500 hours between all of the games, dating back to DOS.  While I'm not an expert on any game in particular, I grew up with the series and despite the sacrifices made to complexity, Bethesda always seems to add enough to each iteration to make the TES series stand out from all of the other games being released at the time.","2715":"Personally I think Morrowind is the best.\n\nSkyrim is easily one of the most bafflingly overrated games for me. Dull.","2716":"I don't get it. I am currently plat 3 and I took a 2 week break from ranked. That was before the shaco nerf and I barely saw shacos then but now when I come back AFTER the shaco nerf I got 3 shacos in ranked 3 times in a row. Am I missing something? I'm very confused.\n\nTL;DR Shaco being played more after nerf.","2717":"Just wait untill the jungle changes make counterjungling even more effective..","2718":"One does not simply catch shaco.","2719":"It's always not Shaco","2720":"One of them was me on my bronze smurf briingthenoise. I remember telling Vayne to lane swap and he ended up carrying hard :D.","2721":"Was wondering if anyone else has a game, or series of game, that despite universal acclaim, and huge fanbases, they've never been able to enjoy?  For me it's the (heresy to most people) Zelda games.  Honestly could not ever get into them, despite the fact that they are very similar to other games that I've enjoyed.  Discuss.\n\nEdit: I would like to see the other side as well, games you love that no-one else gets.  Also, defend your game of choice. ","2722":"Games like Starcraft. Can't do those. ","2723":"I've never actually played Starcraft, despite liking RTS games.  Saw some competitive videos from Korea, and realised that if the game requires that level of quick clickiness, that I would suck balls at it.","2724":"Soccer\/football games. What's the point?\n\nAlso Counter Strike to an extent. Very repetitive - I quite like a bit of variety.","2725":"Every time I think I'm getting into soccer, I watch another 0-0 draw and just sit stunned at the pure pointlessness of the past 90 minutes.","2726":"Don't get me wrong, I sometimes enjoy watching a game on TV or (brace yourself) actually having a kick-about. But playing sports of any sort on a computer or console is just really boring. It takes all the magic of a game - the adrenaline, the sportsmanship, the unpredictability - and turns it into a stilted parade of formulaic interactions.","2727":"I'm not trying to sound like a jerk or anything but I really disagree with you on this. I play a lot of NHL as I'm an avid hockey fan and I get really excited playing it. I get pumped whenever I throw a big hit, pissed off when I get scored on or lose a game and I can't count how many times I've leaped off the couch in excitement because I scored a goal to tie it up late or something like that. I agree with you that the sportsmanship is gone (unless maybe you play online) but as for the magic of the game I still think its there.","2728":"Yeah a lot of people feel the same way you do, probably the majority, and I think it's one of those things which attracts some people and just doesn't interest others. I just can't get excited about them, and I find the gameplay a bit clumsy sometimes (trying to control a whole team with a pad). Also, you're an avid hockey fan - I'm not a very big fan of the sports which appear in video games, so that probably doesn't help.\n\nI'm quite fond of racing games, like Gran Turismo and things like that, but I'm aware that they bore other people. I reckon as the industry advances, people will identify with certain games more and there'll be more distinction between the genres. Also I reckon gameplay will become more immersive and multidimensional as the technology evolves.","2729":"Everything you just said made more sense than I could imagine.","2730":"I really and truly hate online multi-player of any kind. ","2731":"I'm totally with you, I find a lot of people online are douches and if I'm gonna play multi-player, I'd much rather play with a friend. I also have zero interest in MMO's.","2732":"I totally agree. I've tried a few MMOs, but something about it just doesn't appeal to me. ","2733":"Because of the gameplay, or the other players?","2734":"I think it's kind of a mix. A lot of the time, I find that, even if I run into some cool people online, I'm just not really interested in playing online. I'm just more of a solo player in general.","2735":"Have to be honest, I tend to play solo as well, but I find the idea of MMO's fascinating.  The only one I ever got into for a short while was EVE.  I loved the fact that they'd basically just created a parallel reality.","2736":"Zelda is kinda boring. The games I play need more plot (like Square Enix basically). Puzzle games are fine, but please don't pretend there's a plot when there isn't. \n\nSports games are also incomprehensible. Maybe makes a good party game, but that's about it. ","2737":"I would argue the puzzle game thing, but only because of Puzzle Quest.  That totally changed my idea of what a simple pick up and play puzzle game could be.  \n\nI am a huge fan of the SQENIX games, p until they becam a publisher and not just a developer.  They seem to have lost some of their focus now.","2738":"Yeah 13 and 13-2 have been kinda disappointing. I mean, they figured out how to sell to an American audience, but lost a lot of original fans in the process. \n\nAlso, TWEWY has the best storyline. \/ok","2739":"Not played it.  My wife has a ds, but I don't really use it.  Would you recommend doing so?","2740":"It is the best RPG that has been created for the DS, if not the best game period. \n\nSo, uh, *yes.*","2741":"Just bought it from amazon.  If it turns out to suck I'm holding you responsible...","2742":"If you don't like RPGs, don't blame me. If you like them at all, you're welcome. ","2743":"Seems odd to take a recommendation from a thread about games that others love, that you hate though...","2744":"No, no. I love the game. RPGs aren't for everyone, though. If you so happen to hate RPGs you won't like TWEWY. \n\nEither way, give it a shot. :P","2745":"RPG's are kind of my go to genre.  More eastern than western as well, so it may be a good fit.  I find the worlds in most western RPG's to be very samey.","2746":"I loved the water temple :)","2747":"You're the worst kind of person","2748":"I applaud both your verbosity, and eloquence, and this is what I wanted to see here.  I'm Thirty, been gaming almost all of those years, and I know how much games can mean to people.  It always struck me as odd, that despite how much everyone else in the world, except me seemed to love the zelda games.  It's not even as though I can Point to one thing and say 'this.  This is what ruined the game for me.  This is the one thing that caused me to revile on of the most beloved franchises of all time.'  Thanks for the input.","2749":"Metal gear solid, COD, Gears Of War. I hate most shooting games. But I squeeee like a little girl when a new Halo comes out. ","2750":"Personally I love metal Gear, even the hugely laboured cut scenes.  COD, it depends on the actual game.  Gears I enjoyed, once I got used to the fact that the controls were kinda clunky.  I'd played Uncharted on the ps3, before playing it, and there were a lot of similarities in the cover and shooting mechanics, but uncharted just handled so much more smoothly.  I never got Halo, though.  What makes it your choice?","2751":"First real shooting game I played (other than the amazing Goldeneye of course), I was a youngin when it came out and played it all the time, read the books, etc. I just like the story arc more than anything else. I think a game that is fun online is ok. But the story arc is the best part to me. ","2752":"That's an interesting thing that's come up here.  It's commonly held that single player\/campaign is dead, but from what people are saying (and my own views) plot, and story are important to gamers.","2753":"We are in the minority.

This is reduced by 50%, giving 50% true *and* apparent attack speed and 0.5 attacks per second.\n\n2. Slows attack speed by 50%. Total 100% true attack speed to start, with 1.0 attacks per second.

For this reason I suggest you get a B85 motherboard instead, so that you can use these USB3 ports.\n- You can get a 4GB R9 380 for the same price as a 2GB GTX 960, and the 380 is a much more powerful GPU.

Recently I bought an external adapter to read and recover data off of old drives.\n\nWorked just fine for the modern 1 Terabyte SATA HDD, (I used DriveImage XML to recover files).\n\nI have two older 40-GB PATA drives that seem OK from a hardware perspective, and when I connect them to windows they show up in devices, but don't get mounted.  I think they are both formatted windows XP.\n\nIn linux I can create a disk image (.img), and transfer them over to my windows partition, but when I try to mount the image it says \"The disk image file is corrupted\".  Linux can mount the image but doesn't recognize the format.  DriveImage XML doesn't recognize the file as something it can open (I think because it is not mounted).\n\nIs there other software I can use to read this file?\n\n**Edit:** The two drives were in RAID setup.  Downloaded ReclaiMe RAID recovery and was able to get an image file written and mounted.  Thanks to all who replied.","3013":"Ubuntu has [official support documentation](https:\/\/help.ubuntu.com\/community\/MountingWindowsPartitions) on how to mount NTFS drives. Did you even try Googling your problem? Because that was literally the first result.","3014":"Yes, that's how I have the windows partitions on my computer mounted to linux.  I believe I tried this, but don't recall the result.  One sec while I flip over to linux to try this again.\n\nEdit: Well the first consideration on the page you linked regards using the file manager, which is how I was able to get disk images in the first place.  But going back to the physical drives, the site you linked says:\n\n> If your blkid output does not include partition labels, this means that the partitions do not have labels and you will have to determine which partition you wish to mount by another means.\n\nwhich is the case for the drive in question.  Unfortunately the page doesn't seem to say what those other means are.  I assume it would involve the direct path, in my case \/dev\/sdd but i don't know the proper syntax to use.  Also, it seems to recognize a drive at first and then stop recognizing it when I swap out another.  So I will maybe have to restart if I want it to be able to read the drive again.\n\nAnother problem is that the drives are not showing up as type NTFS but rather type \"silicon_medley_raid_member\".  Which is odd because I know at least one of them was formatted with windows XP.","3015":"Hmm, it should be able to mount these drives out of the box. Try running the command: \"dpkg -l ntfs-3g\" in a command prompt. This will tell you if the package needed for reading NTFS drives is installed. If so...\n\nHave you tried the instructions in the \"Manual Configuration\" section? They walk you through how to find your device labels and create your own mount points for them.\n\nThe ID's on the drives might behave unusually because you're not hooking them directly into the system, you're hooking them up to an external adapter. The \"silicon_medley_raid_member\" may be some ID for the adapter, or a generic ID that it gives to drives it can't recognize.\n\nIt's pretty common for external adapters to behave oddly when you swap drives. You shouldn't have to restart the whole computer, just try unplugging the adapter, and connecting the next drive to it before plugging it back into the computer.\n\nEDIT: Just had another idea.

I can't buy anything now in the market, I live in great development, my payments aren't going up like my friend's rents are (hot market), I can handle the payments, I got an under 4% loan, and PMI drops when I hit 78%. \n\nYou can ask your realtor to get a utilities estimate from the seller, but that's obviously a rough number as well. \n\nBe sure you get an inspection and keep a reserve emergency fund available. Newly bought places are notorious for needing at least one huge repair right away (I had a $1200 plumbing bill). ","3127":"We also bought with 3%. I suppose there may have been some risk doing it that way, but we were confident the market would be going up, and wouldn't be able to buy in another year or two. We were right. A little over a year later it had appreciated enough to refinance, drop PMI and get a sub 4% interest rate. Three years later we have 43% equity in it without making any extra payments, and renting a similar place would cost several hundred dollars more per month than our mortgage. ","3128":"Licensed Assistant here - \n\nWhen you meet with the agent at the property you'll want to ask these questions: \n\n1) What are the Assessments on the property?  \n2) What do the Assessments cover? (Some properties pay everything including electricty and water, even internet).  \n3) Ask about if there are any \"Special Assessments\" in place. Special Assessments are additional assessment fees that the Association's board and its unit owners have voted to put in place for special projects that need to be done to the building (Such as tuck-pointing). Special assessments are temporary.  \n4) Ask if you can get the by-laws\/declaration. These are the rules regarding the property. It will tell you if there are fees regarding the use of common elements, if there are fines in place for excessive noise, etc.  \n5) Ask if the Association is ran by the Owners in the building or if it is managed by a property management company.   \n6) Ask if all assessments have been paid and are up to date.  \n7) Ask if there are any pending foreclosures (lis pendis) properties in the complex.  \n8) Condos are cheap for a reason - everyone hates them. I live in one, and my mom and I are fighting the dumbasses upstairs and downstairs because they think that since they're on the board, that their word is \"by-law\".  It's basically an over-glorified apartment building. \n\n**Edit** However, the bigger the complex, the better. If you're eyeing a 8 unit complex - this becomes a close knitted \"community\", and be prepared to bump heads with people who do not agree with your lifestyle.\n","3129":"The HOA is going to vary wildly depending on the type of condo. Mine are very low but ours is more condo in name only, we just live in 1\/2 a duplex so it's a lot cheaper when it's just you and your neighbor. However be very wary of buying a condo in a 100 unit building or something, if something like the elevator breaks the HOA can sky rocket to pay for the repairs. ","3130":"I own a townhouse managed as a condo in a small development (few units, nicely maintained but no fancy features like pools and such) and the HOA fees is about what I would pay anyway to maintain the exterior of the place (which the HOA does), and having few units we do have a good control of how money is spent.   \n\nSo I wouldn't let that deter the OP from getting into a condo; I would however have a close look at the bylaws (most HOA use pretty standard rules with a few specific additions, look at those), and the minutes of past HOA meetings (good way to know about potential issues).","3131":"My husband and I bought a condo about just before the market crashed. It's one of a 4 unit building. More like a glorified apartment. Market crashes, over half the people get booted, value crashes. Now, our HOA dues keep increasing because we have to make up for all the empty units. More people keep leaving. The buildings are deteriorating.  If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't. The only condo I would consider is in a high rise in the city. Less exterior to upkeep. ","3132":"A condo is all of the cons of owning a house (risk, cost, illiquidity) with none of the pros (privacy, complete ownership, control over what you want to do, flexibility). I would almost never advice buying a condo to anybody. If you're just too lazy to do yardwork, find a house that is cheap enough that you can factor in payments to a landscaping company to keep it up. Or rent an apartment.","3133":"Depends on the area.  In my current, big-city neighborhood, single family homes just don't exist for less than $1-$2 million.  The reasonably-priced housing stock is condos, townhomes, and apartments.  And if you want 3+ bedrooms, apartments are out.  So you'll be buying a condo or a townhome (which is similar).","3134":"That doesn't mean it's not still a bad financial decision. One could argue that the place you choose to live is in itself a bad financial decision. Of course what's best financially doesn't always align with what we want or choose to do and that's your prerogative but for the purposes of discussion (whether it's financially a good idea to buy a condo) I'm going to say a big no no matter where you choose to live. As I said, there's always renting. Or you could move somewhere else that has more attractive real estate (financially speaking).","3135":"Nope.  Living where I live instead of the 'burbs saves me the cost of owning a second car (including the $300\/month it would cost to park it downtown), plus shaves 30 minutes each way off my daily commute.  If we consider my time to be worth what I'm paid, consider that to be worth a couple thousand bucks a month.\n\nLiving in a different city would require either being thousands of miles from family (meaning seeing them less and spending $$$ on plane tickets to visit multiple times a year) in order to live in a cheaper-COL city with similar job prospects, or taking a six-figure pay cut.\n\nAs far as rent versus, buy, that's just a basic financial calculation.  In light of the market and personal circumstances, buying made sense financially when I bought.  If I rented instead, I would be financially worse off today.\n\nI'll allowing that it may be rare for condos to make sense financially.  Specifically, it may be limited to certain major cities.  But those cities are often where the best job opportunities are located.","3136":"Again, you can make up for the fact that it is a poor financial decision in other aspects or justify it with roundabout math that softens the blow. But that doesn't make it not a poor decision on its own. Hindsight isn't a valid calculation factor either. And it's pretty obvious you're just arbitrarily sticking with your own personal decisions because they're yours. I guarantee if something happened to your job and you were forced to, you could find just as good job opportunities in cities that don't have such upside down real estate markets. Are they your first choice? Of course not. But this is, again, a discussion about financial ramifications, not preferences and life style choices. Don't take it personally, nobody said you made the wrong choice.","3137":"You're talking about renting versus buying a condo, and saying that the latter is always a bad choice.  That's just wrong from a financial perspective.  Plug your numbers into a calculator.","3138":"I have to agree with DocBrownMusic on this one. A condo is a terrible idea IMO. The only benefit I can think of is that you don't have to worry about your rent going up every year...everything else is terrible.","3139":"We're probably not going to be able to guess the HOA fees, there are too many variables there.  They should be somewhere on the listing for the condo, otherwise you can ask the realtor.  Same for property taxes.  \n\n10% down and only $7k left in the bank probably isn't enough cash to have for this.  Remember you're probably also going to need to buy a lot of stuff when you move in.  Furniture, appliances, dishes, etc.  How much additional are you saving every month?  You'll still need to have an emergency fund once all is said and done.  \n\nIf you're getting a 4k-5k raise soon, you'll likely be in a much better position in a year or so, assuming you put the raise directly into savings.","3140":"HOA fees will depend on the particular HOA.  Call them up and ask or go to the building and talk to some current residents to see what they think of the place.\n\nUtilities may include electric, gas, sewer, water, and trash. These will depend on the location.  In places where it's hot you'll pay a lot for AC. In places where it's cold you'll pay a lot for heat.\n\nPMI fees vary, depending on the size of the down payment and the loan, from around 0.3 percent to 1.15 percent of the original loan amount per year.  You will pay PMI with 10% down on a 30-year note.  With a 15-year note 10% down is enough to avoid PMI.\n\nTaxes are dependent on the location.  Think $1-3k\/yr ballpark.  Insurance is likely to be on the order of $500-$1000\/yr.\n\nAll in all you're looking at $500-$700\/mo in PITI mortgage payments for a 30-year and $600-800\/mo for a 15-year note.\n\n*In my opinion this is too much for someone making $29-34k.*","3141":"Another thing to think about before deciding to move might be to talk to the neighbors(not the person who is selling*) in the other condo's and ask how reasonable the HOA is at that location. Some are just terrible and you really don't want to be stuck at a condo when the HOA are a bunch of useless assholes. \n\nLots of horror stories here on reddit also about HOAs\n","3142":"A big part of real estate is resellability. If a bank will give you a loan and you think this can be resold and you want to live there, a $75k home is reasonable.\n\nAnother big factor is how long it will take to pay it off. $75k amounts to a $304\/mo 30-yr or a $459\/mo 15-yr mortgage, which you should probably double to include taxes, utilities, repairs, insurance and HOA. If it's a home that will eventually house your wife, three kids and a dog, it may make sense for you to be paying that off until you're 55. If it's a starter bachelor pad condo, I'm of the opinion it probably doesn't. Then again, some rational people are fine with paying a mortgage until they die, so decide for yourself.\n\nThe only things I'm counting on with this recommendation are that you are actually getting that raise and that you will save up the 20% to avoid PMI. If so, and if you can stick to a budget well, I can say from experience you could pay this off in under 10 years, after which it's basically a heavily discounted apartment that you own.\n\nFYI, when budgeting for your home, you may want to take a look at a [Mortgage Amortization Calculator](http:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/calculators\/mortgages\/amortization-calculator.aspx?loanAmount=60000&years=30.000&terms=360&interestRate=4.5&loanStartDate=08%2F15%2F2014&monthlyPayments=380.01&monthlyAdditionalAmount=0&yearlyAdditionalAmount=0&yearlyPaymentMonth=+Aug+&oneTimeAdditionalPayment=0&oneTimeAdditionalPaymentInMY=+Sep+2014&pDate=Aug+15%2C+2044&show=false).","3143":"Although not exactly the same, I posted a thread about this when I was in a verrrry similar situation about a year ago that got some great responses:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/17wm6e\/25_years_old_35kyr_salary_am_i_crazy_for_wanting\/","3144":"I guess this all depends on where you live but in some areas, to get a loan to purchase a condo, you must put 20% down. ","3145":"Yah, I'm in Northern AL. Some friends of mine just bough a condo sub 20% down.\n\nNot saying you're wrong, just input :D","3146":"How much do you currently pay for your housing?  The numbers seem okay, but I don't know how it fits into your budget.\n\nHow long would you want to live there?","3147":"I pay around $300 a month in HOA fees, so it's a significant number and is actually more than my mortgage. That said, with all the HOA's, mortgage, insurance and taxes I'm paying $700 a month for a two bedroom where I was paying almost $800 a month in rent for a one bedroom a few miles away.\n\nMy closing costs were around 3% of the total cost and I put 20% down and it sounded like I would have had a hell of a time getting a lender to consider a condo if I hadn't have done that.\n\nStill, all things considered I'm really glad I did it.","3148":"I live in Arizona and just purchased a townhouse and got an FHA loan at 4.25%.  I pay PMI as I put 3% down.  My payment is less about $630 including taxes and insurance.  HOA fees are $187, but cover all outside maintenance, pool, spa, basic cable and internet.  I paid to have an inspection done and the seller paid to have the roof resealed and some plumbing done (about $1,000).  The place was completely furnished, down to pots, pans, dishes, glasses, etc.  It had been used as a rental for winter visitors.  Paid $85K for it and couldn't be happier.

Sure, \"If if bleeds it leads\" is a news maxim, but I think that many people are genuinely concerned for the people of Oklahoma, and want to know what's going on. It could also spur donations to various organizations responding to efforts there. In addition, your state, county or city may have sent first-responders to help out, and this may be of interest to their families. During Katrina, we had tons of really good people who took time out of their lives and come down to help in any way that they could have.

I am in need of a car and was wondering how to go about it. I currently have a full time job and will be going to college as well, so a car would certainly be helpful! \n\nAs for my income\/resources, I live with my parents and take home $585 every other week. I have a credit card from my bank with a $500 limit (paying it in full each month!). And I have a savings account with $100 in it as well. \n\nBills are limited to health insurance ($150 a month) and Netflix really.\n\nI was wondering if it would be wiser to save up and buy a car outright or if it would be better to get a car loan to build credit. I'm fairly new to all of this but I did have a basic financial literacy class in high school. Any help is appreciated!","3353":"Saving up and buying a car outright is 100% the right choice. You should be able to find a reliable car for $5k or so that would last you quite some time and also be low cost to insure. IMO, stick to Honda, Toyota, and Nissan.","3354":"The reason it's better for you to buy outright vs. a loan is it is unlikely you will get a good interest rate.  If you could get a 2% loan, sure, you could get a loan.  But likely any loan you get will be in the 8-10% range, which is pretty bad.\n","3355":"Paying monthly payments on a depreciating asset is financially unsound. Search youtube for \"drive free cars for life\" or use the link https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BKyV8CTHeJ0. The assumptions aren't always perfect, but the premise is sound. The anchors on middle class financial success are car loans, student loans, and credit card debt. Your credit score is calculated on 5 items that measure how well you support your creditors, and 0 items that measure your financial success. :) ","3356":"Even if those payments are 0%? I know it's likely not the case in OP's situation, but just for arguments' sake. A 0% loan is one of the best things you can get, because you're actually saving money due to inflation.","3357":"Yes. Consider a real life scenario, one I use to teach this. Real Jeep (the owner believed it was worth $35,000 at the time of purchase, but that is irrelevant) bought for $25,000 on a 5 year 0% loan, payments of $416\/month. 4 years later, the KBB value for private sale in great condition was $17,000. The owner still owes $5,000. Thus, he has systematically invested $416 a month, or $20,000, and turned it into $12,000. How many times does he need to do that to become a millionaire? If he had instead invested in mutual funds for those 4 years (we picked TSP for our example, which had averaged over 15% return in that time frame, but used 12% for our math), that $20,000 would have turned into $26,700. How many times do you have to do that to become a millionaire? Still a lot of times, but at least you are using your monthly cash flow to increase your wealth rather than waste it on something going down in value. Buy what you can afford with cash, and invest the rest to save for what you want to buy next. Your most important wealth building tool by far is your monthly cash flow.","3358":"The KBB is irrelevant unless you're liquidating the car. Cars aren't investments. They're tools. I could also buy a car for $25k, pay it off in 5 years at 0%, then use the rest of the car's life saving up what I would have paid to buy another car later.

Lets face while the average Atheist is smarter than the average Christian you're still going to have dumb atheist.  The idea that science can explain the Universe and we don't need magic anymore is not a complicated idea.  So we are going to get things that are simple and people just want quick karma.  Be glad it is happening, it means we are appealing to the masses and you don't need a high college education to be an Atheist or Agnostic ","3373":">But I wonder how often atheist redditors stop to remember the reasonable ones, that just want to have their beliefs, and be left alone.\n\nI remember them, and I treat them just fine. However, when I speak out against the absurdity of their beliefs (in a general context) and they rush to defend them, what am I supposed to do? People *ought* to believe what is true. That is why we have schools; because we believe society benefits from people knowing true information. I'm not going to hunt down believers and harass them, but I do not think that there beliefs deserve respect or a place of honor in the public discourse.\n\nFact is, most of the time religion never comes up in my one-to-one conversations and doesn't have a huge effect on my friendships. I do post things about religion on facebook which tends to attract people to discussions. Once they voluntarily enter the discussion, I have no need to hesitate from speaking the plain truth.","3374":"Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!  Well said!!!

It's not a bunch of neckbeards who dwell here every single day for the purpose of mocking religious people.\n\nInsulting, making fun of, or merely questioning one's religion is a very drastic step to take. \"There are two things friends don't talk about: politics and religion\"... this is a usual social rule that works most of the time. But this here is a public discussion board about atheism specifically, so it doesn't apply here, but don't expect the effects of putting one's religion on the spot to be any less severe. **People will get mad.** Redditors will get mad. They don't like their dogma to be poked and will preserve it like it's the untarnished picture of their loving mothers, some going as far out as to twist the violent words of the bible and many religious power figures, just so that they can still believe their faith is just. tl;dr: You will be called a neckbeard or a 14year old idiot. This is normal and expected.\n\nThis subreddit is a valuable resource for many who are having doubts, or are having trouble sorting out their feelings regarding their own religion. This is hard, you all know it is. That's why we need quality content to make people think, to let them know that we think as well. We are not teenagers who hate god just because, but instead most of us have come to a logical conclusion that god, the omnipotent presence that was described by many, doesn't exist in the way most think it does. I don't like it when people belittle our hard path of losing faith. It's not a chocolate vs vanilla choice, it's a drastic step in life. Most of us are \"agnostic atheists\", and we're proud that we don't know what's the exact origin of the universe, or what's the exact purpose of life. We won't make stuff up about it to make us feel good. As a consequence from our deconversions, I like to think we've developed more skeptical thinking than the general public. Not as many atheists purchase snake-oil treatments, believe in spiritual phenomena, find ET in our backyards, etc.\n\nThis is why this subreddit is necessary. Not only to promote positive atheism, but skeptical inquiry and good will.\n\nJust go easy on the memes, the Facebook dialogs or huge quotes. We need more news, calls for action, inspirational self posts, mind tickling questions, comedic material stemming from original content, debates, etc. This won't stop the ridicule from others, but it will make this subreddit better. I think it deserves to be better.\n\nAs always, [**READ THE FAQ**](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atheism\/wiki\/faq).","3383":"They want to believe all atheist are kids rebeling their parents.  They don't want to come to the truth that Atheism and Agnosticism is not stage young people are going through, it's the way are culture going too. There was a guy I was aruging with on here on this posting who kepted on saying I was 14 or 15.  ","3384":"Let's try to do this *logically*. And no, the \"quotes\" in these posts are not verbatim; I'm summarizing it. \n\n>\"Christians have attacked a lot of people; ergo, Christians deserve to be attacked by us\"\n\nThe problem with this is:\n\n1. who are these Christians?\n2. who have they attacked?\n3. why have they attacked?\n4. when r\/atheism \"attacks\" said Christians, are they the same as (1)?\n\nBecause when you think about it, is it rational for an average Iraqi to throw his shoes at a passing, average American because \"Americans attack Iraq\"? \n\nMoving on:\n\n>\"we must fight the creeping Christianization (or Islamization, if you're in the UK\" of our country!\n\nExcept that mindlessly shitposting (yes, I said \"shitposting\". Because quality posts in r\/atheism - ones that are actually thought-provoking - are very few in number) will not do anything. Who are you trying to kid? What sort of activism do you think posting Facebook screenshots to the (pun not intended) choir would do?\n\nOn the other hand, by needlessly antagonizing believers - those who do actually agree with you, or otherwise on the fence - you are hurting your cause (whatever it is) more than you're helping it. Because unless if you're actually advocating a violent overthrow of the government, you still need numbers to affect a change - and pissing off the theists who *can* be on your side is not going to win you friends (and votes).\n\nFinally\n\n>it's free speech! \n\nI agree. That's why hating on hating is also considered free speech. I lost count on how many people here berated me for disagreeing with them. It's as if freedom of speech goes only one way.\n\nHowever, I would also like to add that \"you can say it\" does not necessarily mean \"you should say it\". Maybe it's a cultural thing, but I believe in \"playing nice\" when possible. Worship what you want, as long as you don't bother me. But in return, I'll also hold my peace and won't comment and how silly your rituals are. Fair's fair and all that.","3385":"So just to clarify - we have a problem with Christians (which we've lumped all into a single group responsible for the acts of individuals) hating us, and use that as our justification to hate them back?\n\nYes the free flow of information may reduce religion's impact, but the free flow of vitriol accomplishes nothing whatsoever.","3386":"Yes, when you have a group trying to bully another group around you're going to get a lot of hatred aimed at that other group.  Let me remind you Christians wield a lot of political power in the US.  If it wasn't for the courts we would live in a Theocracy ","3387":"> which we've lumped all into a single group responsible for the acts of individuals\n\nsorry?   How does this account for the fact that Christianity itself is responsible for it's acts?    What acts that are promulgated as Christian doctrine fly under the radar of responsibility when said acts are carried out by it's adherents?\n\nWhich Christians are responsible for the acts of Christianity and which Christians are not?\n\n","3388":"What, so I should just abandon a bunch of friends solely because they're Christian, yet we all accept each other? ","3389":"Yeah but the Christians are *wrong*!","3390":"They think they are being attacked even when they aren't. The persecution complex some of them have is astonishing. ","3391":"Christian Logic: If you are not allowed to persecute people, you're being persecuted ","3392":"What's also interesting is how much more of a threat atheism is seen as compared with the threat of other religions. We don't represent another god that can be argued against with holy books, we are a group that first needs convincing of the existence of ANY god,let alone theirs. Here their books have no effect because divine revelation is assumed. This scares them, because they have to convince us of their core assumptions and they are unable to do it, and rather than face trying to convince themselves of these assumptions from a null point they prefer to deride and attack those of us who say 'Sorry not convinced. Now could you let me eat this bacon sandwich\/have sex with whomever I want to and consents.'","3393":"Nicely said. Ex christian here, I like \/r\/athiesm because I can heavily relate to the posts since I've seen both sides of the coin of religion.","3394":"Does anger, no matter how justified, always relieve?","3395":"I find that most of the insight in \/r\/atheism actually comes from the comments much more than the actual posts themselves.","3396":"I have no problem with people wanting to be Christian- if they act like Christians. I am an agnostic who works at a retirement home for Christian missionaries. They are terrific people who genuinely tried to love everyone in the world, and none have tried to convert me or tell me that my relationship with my girlfriend (I'm a chick) was a sin. I make sure that those who are wheelchair-bound are able to hear the noon devotionals, and would never interfere with their worship. I do not believe in it, but they do, and I recognize that they find meaning in it. Which is why it's funny to me when Christians accuse me of trying to stuff my gay (well, bi) agenda down their throats. I am happy to live and let live- whatever bitterness I have against Christians stems from their prejudice, not my own.","3397":"The public shamings of Christians because of their anti-gay is one of the reasons why the public has reversed course.  It is Christians who think through thearpy they can \"cure\" gayness.  How many gay people have they made kill themselves because they believed in magic and fairy tales?  I really hate two kinds of people bullies and hypocrites, Christians have a check in both categories.  The funny thing is I am more pro-gay rights than some of my gay friends and I am a straight male ","3398":"So I have had ongoing issues with my inernet, specifically when i check my modem two channels are giving all of the problems.

To keep it simple, Let say the incoming signal has a top-top voltage of 1V. After the splitter the left output will have 0.5V top-top and the right also 0.5V. The lowering of the top-top voltage lowers the signal to noise ratio. (you have a higher chace of a `0`being interpreted as a `1`) This often isn't a problem but if your signal is shitty to begin with you will have a problem.  \n  \nWhat you need is a active coax splitter ( one that has a power supply).  \nIt will gain the signal back to the initial voltage after the splitting happens. It wont affect the quality of the picture it's digital.  \n  \nZero cost tips to improve coax signals:  \n\n* Clean the connectors with alcohol.  \n* Keep the cable away from alternating currents. Like power adaptors, transformers, dimmers, LED drivers and power cables.  \n* Don't buy cheap cables with shitty connectors. If you don't intend on reconnecting the cable often use a BNC or TNC conector  \n","3403":"> What you need is a active coax splitter ( one that has a power supply).\n> \n> It will gain the signal back to the initial voltage after the splitting happens.

You can also use the more expensive active modem return models but only if your modem supports its (check if modems powerlevel (in dBmV) is higher then the splitter out puts) In your case I would recommend a passive one.  \n\n[Here is one I found on amazon](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Motorola-Signal-Booster-BDA-S4-Amplifier\/dp\/B000WPGRKK\/ref=pd_sim_23_2?ie=UTF8&dpID=51kta787SKL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_&refRID=14469SBQVH0KKR1XV5XS)  \n[And a cheaper one that lacks the surge protection](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bi-Directional-Amplifier-Splitter-Booster-Passive\/dp\/B001BMKNZI\/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1458662899&sr=1-3&keywords=coaxial+amplifier)","3405":"If one splitter causes a 'too weak' signal, then an incoming signal is defective - even if something works without the splitter.\n\nNow, has that one splitter failed?

Spending +$100 on a new mobo(your cooler should be fine) wouldnt be worth it for a few extra 100 mhzs","3415":"Oh okay thank you. Any SSD recommendations Im looking at the 250gb 850 evo. Anything better for the money? ","3416":"Just to be clear, the PC you posted is the one you currently own right?\n\nYeah samsung 850 evo is great, you could also get MX100 or BX100 if they are a bit cheaper.","3417":"Yes that is my current build and thank you!","3418":"Liquid and AMD? nonono. Just go with Intel and you will be much more happier.","3419":"As I understand it, the build that OP posts is the one he already owns.","3420":"Would I see any real performance increase going over to intel? Im just doing gaming.\n ","3421":"If you are doing only gaming you should obviously pick Intel over AMD. Those are meant for editing and doing 3D stuff mainly. Intel is hundred times better for gaming.","3422":"Okay thank you!","3423":"If nothing else, buy a nice 1440p or 4k monitor to make good use of that 300 series.\n\nAn SSD too; with your budget, something like the 850 EVO\/Pro with decent space. An SSD is a luxury though so don't let it get in the way of other upgrades.","3424":"Im looking into the Acer G257HU as a new monitor . Would you suggest anything else? I know dell has a 25 inch 1440p thats fairly new so i havent heard to much on it. ","3425":"Ideally you want a monitor that is 1440p, 120hz, IPS and freesync. As far as I know, a monitor with these isn't out yet but I think Asus has one releasing soon.","3426":"u mean season 4? iirc Elise was OP in season 3 ","3427":"i dont care about jungle phase too much, elise was useless outside of jungle phase in season 3. elise is good allgame now since the new AP item.","3428":"more useless than elise in season 3 ? so basically like every single other  jungler .. ","3429":"Rek'sai is a jungler who can easily get to their back line with Tunnel and knock someone up for her team to finish off, while still surviving focus from the enemy team. She isn't meant to be the damage dealer on the team, just someone to set up the carries for kills. \n\nIf you were suggesting that her damage be buffed, her pick-making potential is significant enough that she doesn't need damage. If you wanted junglers with more damage, Vi, Jarvan and Shyv can deal a decent amount while still building mostly tank.","3430":"I'm not sure if meme or serious ","3431":"It seems like I always have pretty average teammates, sometimes they're good and sometimes they're bad etc... But as soon as I enter a promo series, I swear I get the people who are so bad, that you're not sure if they're trolling or trying.\n\nIs the system like this on purpose? Am I just really unlucky? Because only in promos do I get the ADC who dies 9 times before level 6.\n\nP.S. This isn't a rage post\/rant, I'm genuinely asking.","3432":"You actually get those sorts of people all the time, it's just that you remember them more vividly since it's your promos and it matters a lot more.  These people are also sometimes in your game but on the enemy team, just have the mindset that if you have a terrible team one game it's possible that type of player might be on the enemy team in the future.","3433":"I like to (roughly) quote Imaqtpie on soloQ teams. \"If you start a sentence with 'my team,' then you deserve the elo you're at.\"","3434":"But I didn't start a sentence with my team? I was gold V a couple of days ago and within like 4 days I've made it gold II 100 lp so far, I'm almost 100% sure I can make plat by the end of the season. \n\nIt's just a funny observation I've made, that as soon as I enter promos, draven goes 1-9, maoki goes 1-9, and Leona goes 1-4. It's no big deal, but it's just something funny I've noticed. ","3435":"Eh. Just feels like it for you honestly, because your promos feel more important so they're more memorable.\n\nI've gotten AFKs for my promos repeatedly and only in my promos. I've also had the guys that feed and rage. But...\n\nI was 'that guy...er girl' in my promos once, going 0\/10 in probably the worst Jayce game I've ever had. I've gotten carried hard, pretty much just farming and not dying and going along with my team.\n\nIt pretty much evens out when you look at things over time I think.","3436":"Yup. I have no problem getting to promos its winning them thats the problem. However i wouldn't always say its because of \"Those people\" that we lose. I think its because the mindset that we HAVE to win the promos.\n\nputs more pressure on you so when somoene fucks up sometimes you will react emotionally to it because you \"need to win\" Its when flaming or raging starts that you begin to lose the game.\n\nIm only silver on two account but my advice would be:\n\n*Try to think about the games as \"I want to win this\" and not \"i need to\"\n*Try and only concentrate on your lane, it doesn't matter if others are feeding if you get hung up on that you are going to distract yourself\n*Be ruthless: Bleed the enemy of gold. Take all the objectives that you can Drakes, towers, wards are all important as you know\n\n\nNote im not that good at the game but general tips i try to go by hope it helps :)\n\nedit: format fucked up \"*\" is a new point\/ tip","3437":"dont tell people your in promos its just more reason to troll","3438":"You get them in every game. The key problem is that we're much more sensitive to them when we're in our Promos because there's so much more on the line. Just keep calm, keep your team motivated, and do your best not to go on tilt.","3439":"I get \"those\" people in about 75% of ranked games, and then in 100% of promotion games.","3440":"I am a Parliament light smoker (about 3\/4ths of a pack a day). A coworker stopped smoking completely when she started vaping 0 nic. I was intrigued so I got a basic kanger starter kit and ordered some 0 juice. Still smoking. I got some 6 mg juice and it's nice but doesn't really hit the spot like a cigarette.... So still smoking. Should I up to 12mg or 18mg. I don't want to like a higher one too much. :).  Thanks and sorry if this question has been asked before. Really want to vape exclusively.","3441":"What did it for me is actually getting better gear, I know it sounds stupid but it wasn't until I was off of the tanks and on to the rebuildables where i really felt myself quitting and eventually not buying anymore packs. But to each their own. If youre looking to upgrade nic i would recommend to go up to 8 or 12 I wouldn't make a huge jump a higher nic can have a huge impact on throat hit.","3442":"This made a huge difference for me as well.\n\nI was at 18mg on various stuff (ego twists, spinners, etc with kanger tanks). Switched to a Sigelei 100w plus and an Atlantis tank... I'm down to 3mg juice. I still use the smaller stuff occasionally and the 18mg juice just kills me now.","3443":"This. I couldn't actually quit until I invested in a variable volt\/wattage battery (iTaste MVP) and an Atlantis Nautilus. \n\nFinally moved on to RDAs, blowing large clouds and breathing easier with a yummy smell and taste is so much better than cigarettes. \n\nI still do have ocasional cravings, but I would never go back. Started at 6mg, now down to 3mg-0mg, depending on the day  \n\nQuality liquid also helps. Stay away from gas station and smoke shop brands, they're usually cap. ","3444":"Yes I forgot to add this, get a good quality liquid its worth it in the long run. I'm glad people agree! :)","3445":"I've been thinking of upgrading but I know so little that I wouldn't know what to ask for. Thanks for the rec","3446":"I would recommend a Kanger subtank mini which is a tank so you are still familiar and can use the prebuild coils but it also has a rebuildable section so you can build your own coils if you do so wish. They also have a nano version with no rebuildable section if you do so wish. I would highly recommend the kanger subtank mini with even 6 mg should be enough. I was almost a 2 pack a day newport smoker and I only vape 3 mg of nic because I vape at sub ohm levels. even with the stock coil on the subtank mini it is a .5 ohm build so make sure you do have a device capable of handling those low ohm builds. I'm not sure what comes with the kanger starter kit but I would be happy to answer any more questions you may have. Best of luck to you! ","3447":"I know it doesn't even have variable voltage. I'm looking for one with vv that isn't too pricey","3448":"My recommendations is an istick 50 watt. if thats too much for you go with the 30 watt sub ohm, just make sure it can handle down to at least a .5 ohm coil which im almost positive both of those do. Those are great started devices with VV\/ VW modes which aren't too pricy. If you're looking to dive right into it I would recommend a sigieli 150w or ipv3 150 but those will run you a bit more.","3449":"It just so happens that the istick lets you switch back and forth between the two and also when you adjust the wattage the voltage is adjusted to compensate and vice versa.","3450":"Another vote for this. I was also at 18mg, and dropped to 6mg just for going from eGos to RTAs on a Mech. 6 to 3 to 0 is easy after that.","3451":"Thanks. I may try 12. I know I did it backwards so I don't want this experience to sway me against vaping","3452":"I started at 18, am now at 3.  The other component is make sure you get a satisfying flavor.","3453":"How long were you at 18 for? I've quickly learned that I'm a dessert gal. Would really love a coffee flavored one.","3454":"I started at 24mg and stayed there practically a year. It's not the nic that kills you so there is no rush when considering the long journey. As I started upping my set ups, I started dropping my nic. I went from 24 to 18 to 12 in a matter of half a year and now I am rocking 6mg only because I'm on mech mods now and running like 40 watts.","3455":"Will definitely have to check that one out. I've heard a lot of good things about coval","3456":"they have a lot of great flavors, i vape a few of theirs.","3457":"As someone who smokes about half a pack to a full pack a day, the 24 mg mixes made me sick.  I would definitely start low on nicotine, maybe even less than 12.  Worst case scenario, you end up vaping a bit more to satisfy the craving.","3458":"Yes, if 6mg doesn't suffice, up your nic amount.\n\nDo whatever keeps you happy and off of cigarettes.","3459":"I've found as I've upgraded my hardware over time and learned to appreciate flavors more I've gone down in nic levels slowly but surely. \n\nI started at 18\/24 depending on what was in stock on a Kanger EVOD Passthrough. Don't sweat it, in six months time you'll be a 3 or 6mg vape easily. It honestly happens naturally. ","3460":"I'd start at 12. It's very very easy to wean yourself off of nicotine - eliquids don't have MAOIs like cigarettes do - and it's less addictive.\n\nI started three months ago at 18mg and now I'm down to around 3. It's really easy, especially once you start going for more flavor.","3461":"I smoked a pack a day(Camel Menthol Silver) and started with 12mg 3 weeks ago, the following week I dropped to 6mg, and now I'm thinking 3mg already. Granted i started with an evod 2 and upgraded to an istick 30w w\/ a kanger subtank nano.","3462":"So here's how I quit. Might end up being different from you. I started with a basic itaste MVP kit at 12 mg.  I went from 1\/2 a pack per day to 1 cig the next day and clean after that. The most important thing is not to carry any smokes on you and just vape whenever you get the urge. You'll be doing it a lot the first few days. I'm assuming the basic kit is the kanger evod kit and that's probably better than the setup I originally had. \n\nStop by a local vape shop and try out some flavors to see what you like. Shouldn't be too hard getting stuff at 12 mg. \n\nBest of luck to you. ","3463":"Thanks! Great suggestion. I may go to my local B&M and get an ileaf (30 or 50) haven't decided","3464":"If you do end up getting a subtank or one of the newer generation clearomizers, I'd consider even going down to 6mg since they put out a LOT of vapor. ","3465":"So I did it. I got the I stick 50w with the kanger sub tank nano. You were absolutely right, 12 is too much! Thanks","3466":"I wouldnt go up too much with your nicotine percentage. If the point is to wean yourself off of it, it doesn't make much sense to go up right now. Stay Strong and go up only one level. NO MORE! It will only make it more difficult again later.","3467":"Yeah I just ordered a 12mg. Thank you!","3468":"They have access to a Weapons Shop across the street and a Semi-Trailer Truck to carry everyone in. Can they make it, and who will die along the way? Extended cast members like Jazz and Newman are included.","3469":"The Seinfeld crew (notably George (influenced by Elaine) and Kramer) decide that the whole Zombie Apocalypse thing is a hoax, so they spread a rumor about an untouched \"big box store, with concrete walls and automatic reinforced steel fences over the doors\" to get the rest of everyone motivated.  They go out and all get killed.  Kramer consoles the Seinfeld survivors.  \"Yeah they're all dead now but it was either us or them!  They were here and they were eating up all our canned goods.  Now that they're gone, we have enough canned Okra to last a lifetime!  Okra, Jerry, Okra!\"","3470":"Danny Tanner dies trying to clean everything up.","3471":"Everyone commits suicide Jonestown style after having to deal with Stephen Urkel and kimmie gibler in closed quarters for a little while. The two use the newfound abundance of meat to get through the apocalypse. Kimmie gibler and Stephen urkel rise from the ashes of a crumbled society and together develop their brave new world.","3472":"\"Urk and the Gibbler\"","3473":"After a day, Ray Kills Deb and Frank kills Marie. The Friends guys and the kids from 70s Show get a super high in the back of the trailer, Red Forman eventually leads everyone to DC. Apart from the two aforementioned deaths, there are no casualties besides half the survivors who at one point or another got a foot up their asses. ","3474":"Carlton gets scared at the first zombie encountered, runs off and gets eaten.","3475":"And Kelso almost shoots someone...twice.","3476":"Pretty sure Wil takes the bite for him and Carlton gets a gun he isn't properly prepared to use.  Then Wil demands he give him the gun.","3477":"That's only if it's a Very Special zombie apocalypse ","3478":"It is also important to remember that Red Foreman saw combat in Korea I believe.  He is probably the best mentally prepared for this scenario.  He is definitely the most likely to coerce the others into not being dumb-asses and working together.","3479":"That is one crowded apartment.","3480":"Suddenly, a fire breaks out! George is the only survivor. ","3481":"This is the correct answer. Women, children and clowns didn't stand a chance. I don't think anyone would. ","3482":"You should X-Post this to \/r\/WritingPrompts. \n\nAs for the answer everyone here seems to be forgetting that a pissed off Uncle Phil is large and in charge. Him and Red will get everyone sitting quietly in the back of that truck pronto and Jazz and Kelso will be the only ones stupid enough to get themselves killed.","3483":"Carl and hyde make it out. Also probably the red head, and kramer. Red foreman lasts a good long time though.","3484":"I think carlton can survive. ","3485":"Urkel's super science either cures the Zombies or makes it worse.  I think given the amount of 'warm' sitcom characters around, he first makes it worse (maybe like the thriller videi) and then fixes everything","3486":"Red Forman stomps.","3487":"More than a pissed off Uncle Phil?","3488":"If it's the characters, it would go down like some other people have said. If it's the casts (i.e. the real-life actors), I think they can work together and survive, given such favorable circumstances.","3489":"Uncle Jesse can be seen being consumed by the zombie hoard, while managing to cry out \"Have mercy!\"","3490":"They almost make it, but then get in an accident with a van because charlie cut the breaks. WILD CARD BITCHES.","3491":"I see this dividing into factions....Joey, Kimmy Gibbler, Raymonds Brother, Kelso, Kramer, Waldo Geraldo Faldo and Hilary all team up. \n\nRoss, Jerry, Carlton, Carl Winslow, Danny Tanner, Raymond, and Eric Foremen form a group. \n\nThen we get the team of Jazz, Eric's sister Laurie, George, uncle joey, phoebe and her sister urusla, Raymond's dad, Stephon Urkel\n\nFinally it's Hyde, Elaine, uncle jessie, Monica, Raymond's mom, the granny from Family matters, and Geoffrey the butler.","3492":"\n\n\n\n  - Well since the cast of friends are all incompetent\/ self absorbed assholes and would probably die of starvation due to not being able to decide who has it worse... with an exception of joey (the only good character), Joey seems as though he would be a competent fighter. \n  - Jerry Seinfeld and George would be leads of this new team with Kramer playing the wild card. Elaine dies due to being crushed by Newman's sexual advances. Newman dies of dysentery. \n  - Bob Saget goes insane of being picked on all these and slaughters the entire cast of Family Matters and Full House (Old Man Logan style) and Jesse shoots him in pity and joins the team to find a better future than the insanity his long time friend encountered.\n  - The Fresh Prince saves Carlton By pushing him out of the way of a zombie Phil at the great cost of his own humanity, leading Carlton to work out and be a beast of a man who hungers for vengence against whatever caused this tragedy as well as searching for the cure to save his dear zombie Will who he keeps in the basement watching reruns of cheers.\n  - Frank wakes up to find his family dead and he has turned into Frankenstein's Monster (Young Frankenstein) and wanders the earth looking for a television to finish his game.\n  - Red Foreman has trained his family for this day, the day when the commies would come to kill them all. However he came to discover this strain of zombification spawned from cannibis and his family, red-eyed and hungry, turned on him leading him to stick his foot so far up their asses hellfire spewed forth. \n\n This team Jerry, George, Kramer (who would in time try to sell out his team for Masters Tickets), Joey, Jesse, Frank and Red form the team \"The Protaginists\" and they will save us all.","3493":"This needs fan fiction","3494":"No matter what Kelso and Jackie die immediately.","3495":"Barney Stinson Wins. Shhhhh, I know who he said.","3496":"","3497":"[scaphism!](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scaphism)","3498":">The intended victim was stripped naked and then firmly fastened within the interior space of two narrow rowing boats (or hollowed-out tree trunks) joined together one on top of the other with the head, hands and feet protruding. The condemned was forced to ingest milk and honey to the point of developing a severe bowel movement and diarrhea, and more honey would be poured on him to attract insects, with special attention devoted to the eyes, ears, mouth, genitals, and anus. In some cases, the executioner would mix milk and honey and pour that mixture all over the victim. He would then be left to float on a stagnant pond or be exposed to the sun. The defenseless individual's feces accumulated within the container, attracting more insects which would eat and breed within his exposed flesh, which\u2014pursuant to interruption of the blood supply by burrowing insects\u2014became increasingly gangrenous. The individual would be lying there naked, covered from head to toe in milk, honey, and their own feces. The feeding would be repeated each day in some cases to prolong the torture, so that fatal dehydration or starvation did not occur. Death, when it eventually occurred, was probably due to a combination of dehydration, starvation and septic shock. Delirium would typically set in after a few days.\n\n...fucking brutal","3499":"\u0ca0_\u0ca0","3500":"(\u00ac\u203f\u00ac)","3501":"Death by Snu Snu","3502":"The spirit is willing but the flesh is spongey and bruised.","3503":"Given to the Drowned God.","3504":"They would have hundreds of papercuts all over their bodies and be placed in front of a mirror as lemon juice slowly drips over the small cuts for a few minutes.

Fewer cores, but each one is more powerful.\n\nIf you're gaming - take a look here: http:\/\/anandtech.com\/show\/7189\/choosing-a-gaming-cpu-september-2013\/6\n\nThis will tell you a lot about what real-world performance looks like.","3583":"A little more insight into your thought process of cores.

","3584":"After a long time not touching the genre (Need For Speed: Most Wanted is the last one I remember playing for a serious amount of time, the 2005 one featuring the BMW that is), I recently picked up GT5 again and have been having a blast. However, I much prefer my wheel and pedals to my Dualshock, so I've been tossing up AC and PCARS as my choice of first PC racing game in about 10 years. What do you guys think?\n\nOh, and incase I'm not successful in unearthing my decade old driving rig, what's a good beginner model under $100? And would it be worth buying second hand?","3585":"The last time I played PCars was 4 months ago, so some things could have changed.  I also own AC.  \nFrom my perspective PCars is more arcade than AC.The driving is a bit more arcade than gran turismo. The force feedback is bad (about the same as GT), cars are too easy to drive, crashing into other cars has nearly no effect (most of the time the cars just drive straight on after a collision). It looks nice and it's fun to race.  \nAC on the other hand has a much much better force feedback, the cars are harder (and more realistic) to drive than PCars. It also has a very good mod support: You can already download hundreds of cars and tracks for it.  \nTL;DR: PCars is an arcade game like Gran Turismo or Forza. Assetto Corsa is more a simulator  like rFactor.  \n.  \nSteering wheel: You can look for a Logitech Driving Force GT. (Although it has kind of bad pedals, so you should stick to TCS and ABS)","3586":">TCS, ABS\n\nTraction control and Anti-lock brake systems?","3587":"yes","3588":"While more arcadey, is it still a \"good\" game?\n\nAny other sub $100 rigs with better pedals?\n\nThanks for the input!","3589":"Both are good games.  \nThe pedals of a Driving Force GT are good enough for both games. But they make driving without TCS and ABS rather hard, because you can't control the input very good.  \nYou could also search for a Fanatec Porsche Turbo wheel. It's a bit older, but should be better than the Driving Force GT and should go for under 100$ used","3590":"And there are no longevity problems with regards to the Porsche?","3591":"I liked your little review here. It helped me too. Thanks.","3592":"I haven't played Project Cars, but I've owned Assetto Corsa for a while and I will say that its a fantastic *sim* but not a very good *game*. There isn't much of a career mode in AC, just a list of preset time attacks, time trials, and short races. What it is great for is lapping a fantastically detailed track, in a fantastically detailed car, with fantastically detailed force feedback. I haven't spent much time in online races because I haven't had a good experience, lots of lag and public rooms are terrible. Kunos comes out with updates fairly regularly, so that's a plus. I'd recommend it if you just want to drive, but if you want a career with tangible progression, I'd look elsewhere. ","3593":"Assetto Corsa all the way, if your into a full sim experience.\n\nI played PCARS over the last few days and despite it being the release version I didn't like it at all, the force feedback is weak and confusing, the cars handle in an arcade fashion that doesn't really match up to the force feedback. For example, I'll spin and have no real idea why.\n\nAC is much better, the Force feedback is the best I've ever felt in a racing sim, far better than iRacing which WAS the best up until now.\n\nEverything feels right and intuitive, every time I spin I know why and what i did wrong, its defiantly the best sim out there.\n\nIf you want a wider selection of cars and tracks and a bit more of an arcadey feel go with PCARS, if you want full blown sim go Assetto Corsa.\n\nI own a G25 wheel the old version of the G27, I think you can grab a G25 second hand and IMO its still a great wheel. Though I think you can get G27's fairly cheep these days if you look for good deals.","3594":"Wow!

The unit isn't fun to use not is it fun to play against. Its the quintessential \"A move\" unit, all you have to do is press charge. In general it just feels dumb, cumbersome and offers little to no micro potential. \n\nI was disappointed to hear no changes to the Void Ray were scheduled for LotV.

I really liked the Fazing micro you could do with Voids, such a pity DKim went full retard and removed that.","3609":"Didn't the phasing just make the void ray too snowbally? I like it the way it is because it actually fills a role and makes Stargate openings doable. Im more impressed with focusing armored targets than shooting buildings to charge anyway. I could be wrong though because I started in hots","3610":"Nono, fazing is not charging the voidray. \n\n[This is Fazing](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7LDF6iPekYs). It happened becasue the void rays did dmg at the start of the animation, they had insta dmg like the marines or siegetanks, you could do it with sentries too but it was changed when the fazing micro became known, to do fazing you would need to ball up your voidrays and expose some of them to the enemy ranged units, like you do with stacked mutas only much much more clumsy,which meant that you needed to be very very smart when doing it because you could get all your voidrays easily killed if you did it wrong (like with mutas).","3611":"Why was that removed? :(","3612":"Because of design and artistic decisions, it looks funky so therefore it does not belong to a E-Sport title, it also rewards players that are able to click very fast so it doesn't belong to a real time **strategy** game either.\n\nTo me the removal of Fazing is everything that's wrong with the design approach Blizzard took on SC2.","3613":"I agree but it's likely they won't look into it, given how big protoss changes are","3614":"Protoss seems to have gotten the least, with only one new unit. The Void Ray would be a great place to start implementing something fresher.","3615":"The least unit but the warp gate change is as big as the economy change imo.\nThat plus pick up range for warp prism and new immortal etc.","3616":"The warpgate change is a nerf though.","3617":"most of protoss stuff so far seems to be a nerf, isn't related to the topic though.

Protoss could get some actually strong Gateway units as a result.\n\nHowever the proposed Warpgate change in LOTV is meaningless. Production is still frontloaded before you pay, and you can still warp in near an enemy base.","3619":"I think what they could do is make the charge activate if you focus on a single unit long enough, and go away if you haven't fired for a time. That will inspire some great micro of progamers trying to keep the charge alive by \"juggling\" the void ray while microing it to ensure the charge stays active.

And nobody used it !\n\nThe voidray as a unit is absolutly k. I dont see why the unit needs a redesign. I dont believe thats not fun to use it. I believe its the other way around. Its unfun to play against because it can be very strong. But thats not a reason to redesign a unit. Its time to give zerg a better option to deal with it !\n\nWith the new infestor, hydra and lurker it should get a lot better. Lurker saves u from chargelots while hydras on \"bloodlust\"(new infestor spell) take voidrays down !","3622":"Void rays are one of the most boring and bland units in the game. They bring nothing to the game other than a 'cool factor'. I like the idea of a laser beam unit, but the current form is a total snooze fest. It would be interesting to see the Void Ray become a spellcaster where you aim the laser beam like a skillshot, sort of like [Lux's ult from LoL](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R8DXfE8T5mk). Anything that creates more micro relationships would be nice. ","3623":"I think the Void Ray should steal the Oracle's energy-based beam ability.\n\nThe Void Ray would have energy, and when toggled on would rapidly spend energy to drastically increase its DPS.\n\nWithout spending energy it might take the place of the Oracle as a harassment unit dealing bonus damage to Light units. And when spending energy it will very rapidly deal damage to any unit type. However once its energy runs out, you should probably withdraw them to accumulate more energy.","3624":"I just don't like abilitys where there is zero reason not to use it. Laser on, more damage..... Great..","3625":"To be fair the bonus damage is only against armored targets. I can't tell you how many times I've seen someone use that against marines, lings, hydras, zealots...","3626":"So many times when my opponent builds void rays they think it works versus queens.","3627":"I think in the current meta there are no problems with the void ray. \n\nSure, it's not the most interesting unit in the game. It has little micro potential and serves really only to add a bit more DPS to protoss armies. \n\nBut I think that's fine. Really the only use you see in modern times is in PvZ as a buffer between stargate openers and colossus based armies as a way to safely get that third up. You also occasionally see hatch or tech snipes with a pack of void-rays but those are pretty rare. The role as a support unit in the mid-game is served perfectly by the voidray, and because of it's slow movement speed it can be out-maneuvered by the faster zerg units. \n\nWhat I certainly do NOT want, is to see the void ray become a mainstay of protoss armies. I think collo-sentry-stalker vs hydra\/roach viper is much more interesting than seeing that wall of blue decimate whatever mediocre anti-air zerg decided to lose with. \n\nSo what do I want? Honestly, I'm not really sure. What I will say is that I'm interested to see how the nydus changes will effect the zerg mid-game. The ability to get in the main with some roaches more easily will allow the zerg to hit the protoss from more angles and make void-rays less effective in this scenario. \n\nSo really, we have to wait and see what else Blizz has planned for LOTV.

It certainly is valuable to disprove existing \"truths,\" but if we do not come up with at least plausible alternatives, these falsehoods inevitably tend to morph and reemerge in a different form. Thus did the death of religion give rise to totalitarianism - just another worship of an abstract and irrational moral absolute; the \"State\" rather than a \"God.\" The unjust aristocratic privileges of minority that the founding fathers so railed against simply morphed into the unjust privileges of the majority in the form of \"mob rule\" democracy - which then morphed back into the unjust aristocratic privileges of the minority in the form of a political ruling class\" ","3839":"Wow, I find it laughable that so many \"skeptics\" in the atheist community are so adverse to skepticism when it comes to government.

For example, the combination of the -highest life expectancy- AND the -highest GPD\/capita- AND the -lowest unemployment rate- can be found in the following countries: Monaco, Cayman island, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Bermuda, etc.\n\nAll of these country have on the one hand : a very small very limited government with few regulations, and on the other hand : the top life expectancy, lowest unemployment, top income\/capita trio.\nFor example, Monaco has 0% unemployment, 201 000$ GDP\/capita, 95 years life expectancy. It is also the country with the least taxes and regulations worldwide. The same can be said of the other countries I mentioned, however, since they have a little bit more regulations and taxation, the stats are a little bit less impressive.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, you have countries like congo or somalia, where there is no official or practical limit to the power of the ruling party or parties. You get the lowest stats.","3866":"I don't know how who can possibly describe anarchy as practical.  It's the most impractical ideology in existence.  Are there going to be police in this anarchist society? If so who's going to pay them?  Are there going to be public roads or are they going to be built by private companies and you pay at a toll booth every few hundred metres? Who's going to regulate the currency? Who's going to regulate safety standards?  Are you happy to hop in a plane that hasn't had to meet safety standards? Or after a few crashes will the invisible hand ensure that dodgy operators don't get any business?  Anarchy is idiotic.","3867":"Without a state, I'd think your questions would be answered with more questions: Which police force do you want? How much are you willing to pay them? Which roads do you want to travel on, those with frequent tolls or would you rather pay a lump sum monthly or yearly or are there actually toll-free roads because they lead to shops that want your business? Which currency do you want to use? Which businesses comply to the safety standards you trust? Would you fly on an airplane that doesn't meet them?","3868":"So in this anarchist society there would be multiple police forces and only those who could afford to pay them would be protected? That sounds...interesting.  Multiple currencies as well? That sounds ripe for exploitation and speculation. What's to stop counterfeiting if there's no government to regulate? I guess the banks could send the private police they have on retainer to punish them. This all sounds ridiculously impractical and chaotic to me. ","3869":">Are there going to be police in this anarchist society? If so who's going to pay them? \n\nobviously people who want police protection and people who want to voluntarily subsidize poor neighborhoods by researching and selecting an efficient (and not brutal) police force.\n\n>Who's going to regulate the currency?\nWhat regulations of currency are necessary?  Why do you think there won't be competing currencies, with one or two being determined by the market to serve as good stores of value while being impossible to counterfeit?  Won't consumer demand solve this problem?  Who would want a currency that is constantly bleeding off purchasing power, because the central agency can just print more and lower the supply of real goods by consuming without producing?\n\n> Who's going to regulate safety standards? \n\nConsumers and the profit motive.  Seriously, reputation is crucial to doing repeat business and gaining new business.  As consumers are concerned about safety and things, non-governmental safety standards will come into existence.  Have you ever heard of UL, IEEE, or the scores of engineering standards societies?  They exist today and government has nothing to do with their creation or operation, yet you can find a UL sticker on any electrical appliance that you purchase from a reputable store.\n\n>Are there going to be public roads or are they going to be built by private companies and you pay at a toll booth every few hundred metres? \n\nThat's one possible way it could be run.  Another possible way it could be run is by subscription, where you can't get on that road unless you have a device (like an iPass or an iZoom, basically a transponder that sends an id number to a receiver which checks if you're paid up and lowers spikes or raises a gate or something).  Another way is through donation by businesses.  I'm no central planner, I am not smart enough to be able to see how to control the lives of hundreds of people, much less millions.  But I know that individuals can try out theories as to how they can improve their own lives, and companies will rise to try and realize these theories.  Good theories will succeed.  But you have to stop using violence to force people to subscribe to one firm with a violently enforced monopoly on the provision of many services.","3870":"So I think I'm going through an existential crisis. Starting to second guess reality, people, pretty much everything. Honestly, I've been down this road before, and it ended with me trying to off myself (not a good point in my life, but neither is this). I've been feeling like reality, the world, god, whatever you want to call it has been stopping me from doing something. In this case, going to school. I'm trying to get back in college, and honestly, I don't think I'd have much issue with it if it didn't feel like I was being stopped. \n\nAnytime I'm heading down to school, there's always something preventing me from getting there or succeeding.

School systems not working, suddenly I can't log in to my math homework. Financial aid didn't get here in time, had to kindly ask my mother for a check to cover it until came in. Hell, I even took some random online quiz thing (put in a name, spits out some result based on your name) and it word for word said \"tooexistential73 will pass a chemistry test a long, long time from now\", with chemistry being my major. \n\nThey've gotta be coincidences, right?

Currently have a Hanns-G monitor, but I am not sure if I will stick with it or get another monitor as a second.\n\nI appreciate any part criticism if anyone wants to dole it out, but it falls on deaf ears as the parts are sitting behind me in my office. \n\nThanks for any suggestions.","3948":"GTX 970 - R9 280x - whatever AMD comes out with next for you budget.","3949":"http:\/\/www.tomshardware.com\/reviews\/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html\n\nThey update this list every month.  It's a great resource. You can also use the logical increments guide on the right sidebar. ==========>","3950":"Yeah logical increments is a great tool, blanked on that as I haven't really checked it out in the past two weeks.","3951":"Perhaps I'm blind but I've never seen this recommended. I generally browse \/r\/all. Multiple times every day I go to view what's new and I see the same post posted to 6-7 different subreddits, because that post generally has a valid claim to be in each of those such as health care stuff going to  Health, Politics and Obama. \n\n**Current problems:**\n1) The same post (not same topic, but literally same link and title and submitter) clutter up the new page\n2) Sometimes two of these same posts wind up on the front page. It's completely unnecessary to have two identical posts\n3) When posts like this make it to the front page, they often each of a fair number of comments, so reading comments in two separate links is frustrating and confuses things.\n4) Sometimes to get around this issue, I know some people will simply post it in just reddit.com so that it's more likely to be seen by the larger swath of people. I also know some people don't like having their reddit.com spammed with politics stuff.\n\n\n**Suggestion:**\nWhen submitting a link, allow more than one option in the \"reddit\" field separated by some delimiter. \n\nOnce posted, this would create a single post, that gets posted to each of those reddits, and instead of seeing \"submitted by magelisk to X\" you'd see 'submitted by magelisk to X, Y, Z....\"\n\nThis post would have one comments section which obviously makes it easy to follow the conversations. \n\n\n**Problems with the suggestion**\nProblems I foresee that I either don't know the answer to am unsure of what the end result will be.\n\n1) I'm not a fool, I'm sure it's not as easy as \"just doing it\". I've no doubt that there are back end architecture issues that might prevent this from being a simple implementations.\n\n2) These posts are probably more likely to generate comments from people not normally in your sub-reddit, which could lead to less of a circle jerk of 90% libertarian posts in what you're reading because no those Obama cool-aid drinking politics folks come in and muck up your orgy because now they see the same version as you. On the other hand, this probably isn't a bad things in a community that supposedly values discussion and criticism.\n\n3) People could try to use this feature to spam many reddits at once (like all of them) for whatever malicious (or good intentioned) purpose. \nPossible solution: require being subscribed to any reddit that you cross post to, or limit it to something like 10 or 15 reddits at a time. This sort of limitation would also help ensure that each links \"posted by A to x,y,z\" doesn't go so long that it destroys the generally neat format of the page\n\n4) Comments page needs to be re-done a bit since it will no longer be part of a particular reddit.\n\n5) I'm not really sure what this would do to self posts...\n\n\n*(Note: Before I get flamed for it, any subreddits i pick in examples is usually because of their popularity, not my opions on either, regardless of how I may seem to demean them with my choice of things such as \"circle jerk\")*\n\ntl;dr version: Allow submitting a single link to multiple reddits at once to try to clean up the page and reduce the duplicate posts and separated comments\/conversations. \n\nAlright, feel free to tear this apart now :)","3952":"Right, it'd be effectivly tagged. 'submitted by magelisk to reddit.com, politics, nsfw, gonewild, atheism'. \n\nBiggest issue I see with trying to filter comments by subreddit is that it means comments have to be submitted by subreddit, which probably isn't so much a technical nightmare as it would be a usability one.

I know it can be currently done manually, but would be nice to have a simple GUI interface\/integration with current subreddit bar etc.","3955":"I think this is a great idea.\n\nThe only restriction I would place is that tagging a submission for circlejerk removes all other tags.","3956":"my feature request would be a page listing the longwinded 1 on 1 argument threads that get buried because the two pedantic\/argumentative assholes get downvoted to invisibility.

I realize that it's viewed as \"okay\" to post to multiple subreddits, and I have myself once, I think; but I don't generally like the idea, myself. So I'm prejudiced against the idea from the get-go. So I just intended to make a silly hit-and-run point (with a little bit of truth in there). :)","3962":"Yea, I see spam as being the biggest issue. \n\nAnd I know it's \"okay\" to post in multiple subreddits, I just tend to think there can be a better solution :).","3963":"Think I didn't explain myself well - I *personally* disagree with posting in multiple reddits, so the entire idea is to make it easier to do something I personally dislike; but I can certainly see a discussion on trying to make it easier\/better to do something that is okay, even if I don't like it. hehe","3964":"One of the problems with the current system though is the ridiculous number of reddits, some things are relevant to more than a single topic. Just this morning someone was bitching about something being posted to \/r\/linux instead of \/r\/ubuntu. If there was some sort of tagging system it might be possible to subscribe to linux and block ubuntu if you wanted.","3965":"I foresee people submitting to every subreddit at once.","3966":"A potential problem not mentioned above. If a link is submitted to geek, tech and science, all three of which I subscribe to, and does well in all three then my front page could easily fill up with the same two or three successful submissions.

It helps the industry because more people have access to movies\/shows\/music\/programs and that brings popularity to said product.
